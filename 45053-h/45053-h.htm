<h2 class="main">PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What does a man seek when he examines his religious
creed? To this question Canon Liddon replies as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;He seeks intellectual satisfaction and moral
support. His intellect asks for reliable information upon certain
subjects of the most momentous importance. How does he come here?
Whither is he going? What is the purpose and drift of the various forms
of existence around him? Above all, what is the nature, what are the
attributes and dispositions, of that Being to whom the highest
yearnings of his inmost self constantly point as the true object of his
existence? In asking that the answers to these questions shall be
definite, that what is certain shall be affirmed as certain, what is
doubtful as doubtful, what is false as false, he is only asking that
his religious information shall be presented in as clear and practical
a shape as his information on other subjects. In no department of human
knowledge is haziness deemed a merit; by nothing is an educated mind
more distinguished than by a resolute effort to mark the exact
frontiers of its knowledge and its ignorance; to hesitate only when
hesitation is necessary; to despair of knowledge only when knowledge is
ascertainably out of reach. Surely on the highest and most momentous of
all subjects this same precision may be asked for with reverence and in
reason; surely the human mind is not bound to forget its noblest
instincts when it approaches the throne and presence of its
Maker?&rdquo; (<i>Some Elements of Religion</i>, p. 24).</p>
<p>Again, in his New Year&rsquo;s message for 1905, the Archbishop of
Canterbury condemns indifference to truth as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1356" href="#xd21e1356" name=
"xd21e1356">x</a>]</span>a vice, and &ldquo;drifting along the current
of popular opinion&rdquo; as a sin. He invites and persuades us to use
&ldquo;the sadly-neglected powers and privileges of rational thought
and common sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duty of thinking, therefore, is now recognised by the
Church&mdash;it was not formerly. But what will be the result of this
thinking? In his book, <i>The Hearts of Men</i>, Mr. Fielding tells us
that &ldquo;no man has ever sat down calmly unbiassed to reason out his
religion, and not ended by rejecting it.&rdquo; Mr. Fielding adds:
&ldquo;The great men, who have been always religious, do not invalidate
what I say.... There is no assumption more fallacious than that,
because a man is a keen reasoner on one subject, he is also on another.
Men who are strictly religious, who believe in their faith, whatever
their faith may be, consider it above proof, beyond argument.... It is
emotion, not reason; feeling, not induction.&rdquo; (<i>The Hearts of
Men</i>, pp. 142&ndash;3.)</p>
<p>Does not this deep and sympathetic writer furnish us with a true
picture of men&rsquo;s hearts? What if, after exercising their
privileges of rational thought and common sense, the majority of men
find that Christianity no longer gives them either intellectual
satisfaction or moral support? What if they finally arrive at the
conclusion that Christianity and all supernatural beliefs are but the
survival of primitive superstitions which can no longer bear the light
of modern knowledge? These are the grave questions which now confront
us.</p>
<p>A man may enter, and generally does enter, upon his inquiry biassed
in favour of religious belief of some kind. He approaches the subject
in a reverent frame of mind. In his private prayers to his God he does
not neglect to ask for heavenly guidance. He evinces precisely the
spirit which a divine would consider becoming. But as his inquiry
proceeds there comes a time when his religious bias
disappears&mdash;when he can no longer feel what he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1370" href="#xd21e1370" name=
"xd21e1370">xi</a>]</span>could honestly call reverence. He discovers
that what he thought was known, and had actually been revealed, is
unknown. How can he believe in and worship the Unknown? More than ever
he feels his own insignificance and ignorance; but the feeling thus
excited, while akin to awe, is divested of reverence. Pursuing his
search far enough, he succeeds in extricating himself from a quagmire
of demonstrably false superstitions. Finally he reaches solid ground,
and builds his life upon it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many never pursue their inquiry up to this stage;
they become fearful, or they give it up as a hopeless entanglement, or
they find they have not the requisite leisure. Perhaps, therefore, the
information gained by one of the more fortunate may be of some little
service to others. It will be my endeavour to set forth in this book
not only the destructive, but also the constructive, results of a
search for truth.</p>

critics,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1385src" href="#xd21e1385" name=
"xd21e1385src">1</a> &ldquo;is evidently the honest, outspoken opinion
of one who, having been brought up in an unquestioning acceptance of
the orthodox doctrines of Christianity, has gradually drifted into the
extreme of Rationalism.&rdquo; Up to a certain point my friend is
right. I was indeed brought up in an unquestioning acceptance of the
orthodox teachings of Christianity; but, while my conversion to
Rationalism has certainly been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1391"
href="#xd21e1391" name="xd21e1391">xii</a>]</span>gradual, I may fairly
claim that the process has been something very different from merely
drifting. Long and careful study, the reluctant abandonment of a
cherished belief, the adoption of an attitude which is unpopular and
which distresses many who are near and dear to me, the practical
application of the principles of Rationalism to daily life, involving
as it does the serious step of bringing up my children in strict
accordance with my firm convictions&mdash;these are surely not the ways
of one who has permitted himself to drift. A man might&mdash;he often
does&mdash;drift into indifferentism, or, now that theology is so
liberal and heterodoxy so rife, into latitudinarianism, but hardly into
&ldquo;the extreme of Rationalism.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 1. <i>The Truth of the Matter.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before entering upon an inquiry into religious
unbelief, we need to form a correct estimate of its prevalence. If, as
many would have us think, there is nothing unusual in the present
situation&mdash;if the age of faith is returning,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1432src" href="#xd21e1432" name="xd21e1432src">1</a> it is hardly
worth while to enter upon this inquiry at all. If, on the other hand,
the forces hostile to the Christian faith differ essentially from those
that stirred up waves of scepticism in the past&mdash;if there is
overwhelming evidence that belief among educated men is fast decaying,
it is surely high time to investigate the grounds of unbelief, and to
welcome the fullest discussion concerning the best means of dealing
with an entirely new and extremely grave situation. It is only the
shortest-sighted policy that would shelve a disagreeable question until
mischief had occurred. It is better to face the facts. From every point
of view, concealment regarding a question of such vital importance as
the truth of Christianity is to be deplored; while an attitude of
indifference on a subject that should be of surpassing interest to us
all can only be characterised as amazing&mdash;unless, indeed, the real
explanation be that men have ceased to believe. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>We must, then, determine, in the first place, whether we are
witnessing simply a wave of scepticism that will shortly subside again,
or whether the present situation in the religious world is altogether
unprecedented. The truth of the matter will best be learnt from the
lips of those to whom pessimistic admissions must be peculiarly
distressing, and who would therefore be the last either to raise a
false alarm or to be guilty of an exaggeration. The Bishop of London
has warned us<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1441src" href="#xd21e1441"
name="xd21e1441src">2</a> that &ldquo;the truth of the matter really is
that all over Europe a great conflict is being fought between the old
faith in a supernatural revelation and a growing disbelief in
it.&rdquo; The Bishop of Salisbury lately<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1444src" href="#xd21e1444" name="xd21e1444src">3</a> said:
&ldquo;There has been revealed to us the terrible and painful fact that
a great many are giving up public worship, and that a large proportion
of the people of England pay little attention to religion at
all.&rdquo; Not long ago Lord Hugh Cecil expressed<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1447src" href="#xd21e1447" name="xd21e1447src">4</a> the same
opinion in the following words: &ldquo;On all sides there are signs of
the decay of the Faith. People do not go to church, or, if they go, it
is for the sake of the music, or for some non-religious motive. The
evidence is overwhelming that the doctrines of Christianity have passed
into the region of doubt.&rdquo; From Dr. Horton we learn that
&ldquo;vast numbers of people in England to-day have forsaken the best
and highest ideal of life known to them before they have found a better
and higher.... While Professor Haeckel and Professor Ray Lankester
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>do in their way offer an alternative, and present to
us the solution of the great enigma according to their light, the bulk
of people in our day surrender the old and tried ideal, fling it aside,
assume that it is discredited, live without it, and make no serious
attempt to find a better ideal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1452src" href="#xd21e1452" name="xd21e1452src">5</a></p>
<p>Are there not indications, moreover, everywhere in the literature of
the day? The works of some of our greatest scholars are either covertly
or openly agnostic. The more thoughtful of our magazines, such as the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, <i>Hibbert
Journal</i>, <i>Independent Review</i>, etc., are continually
publishing articles which teem with heterodoxy. The &ldquo;Do We
Believe?&rdquo; correspondence in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (not to
mention the more recent controversies in the <i>Standard</i>, <i>Daily
Mail</i>, and <i>Daily News</i>) was without precedent, and highly
significant of the present state of religious unrest. In a lecture
reported in the <i>Tablet</i>, Father Gerard voiced the growing feeling
of apprehension when he referred to the &ldquo;Do We Believe?&rdquo;
controversy and the &ldquo;amazing success&rdquo; of the Rationalist
Press Association as indicating a situation of &ldquo;the utmost
gravity, as gravely disquieting as any with which in her long career
the Church has ever been confronted.&rdquo; Also it may be noticed that
organised efforts have commenced all over England to answer inquiries
concerning the truth of Christianity by means of apologetic literature
and lectures. What do these inquiries portend? The reply is given in
the warning of the Rev. Mark Pattison in his essay on &ldquo;Tendencies
of Religious Thought in England.&rdquo; &ldquo;When an age,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>found occupied in proving its creed, this is but a
token that the age has ceased to have a proper belief in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whichever way we turn the same spectacle confronts us. In France
especially, and also in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Belgium,
Italy, Spain, the United States, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Brazil, and
Argentina (where the <i>men</i> are practically all agnostics),
freethought is making rapid progress. Only in Russia, where ninety per
cent. of the population are uneducated, is the growth small and
confined to the &ldquo;intellectuals.&rdquo; Never in the world&rsquo;s
history has there been so much disbelief in the
&ldquo;supernatural&rdquo;; and, with the advance of science and
education, this disbelief appears likely to be one day almost
universal. Militant Rationalism is jubilant; while the pastor of the
Theistic Church<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1495src" href="#xd21e1495"
name="xd21e1495src">6</a> proclaims: &ldquo;I see a battle coming. I do
not, like Froude, predict that it will be fought once more, as of old,
in blood and tears; but I am as certain as I am of to-morrow&rsquo;s
dawn that a mighty conflict is at hand which will revolutionise the
religious thought and feeling of Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is sheer folly for the Church to comfort herself with the
reflection that this is not the first time in the history of
Christianity that disbelief has manifested itself. In the early days of
the Church the heretic was not in possession of the knowledge that we
have since acquired. He could not support his views, as he can now,
with the facts of science. At every step he could be met by arguments
which he had no adequate means of refuting, and if he dared to deny the
&ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; there was an enormous preponderance of
public opinion against him. Indeed, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>himself generally believed in
the &ldquo;supernatural,&rdquo; though he was sceptical of the
particular evidence of it on which Christianity had been founded.
Retarded by Christianity itself&mdash;or, shall we say, by its
interpreters?&mdash;knowledge was unable to advance; it receded, and
the clock was put back in scientific research. Darkness reigned supreme
for over a thousand years. At last the dawn began to break. What was
the result? The children of light suffered for their temerity; but
their ideas were eventually absorbed, and beliefs were suitably
reformed. Thus the Copernican system was gradually accepted, and so
were the discoveries which followed, up to fifty years ago. Then,
however, the established beliefs received shock after shock in rapid
succession&mdash;shocks from which they do not yet show any promise of
recovering. The myriads of worlds in the processes of birth and death;
the vast antiquity of the earth; the long history of man and his animal
origin; the reign of natural law, and the consequent discredit of the
supernatural; the suspicions aroused by the study of comparative
mythology; the difficulties of &ldquo;literal inspiration&rdquo;; the
doubt thrown by the Higher Criticism on many cherished
beliefs&mdash;these and the like have shaken the very foundations of
our faith, and are the cause of agnosticism among the vast majority of
our leaders of thought and science.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastics, however, with certain notable exceptions, appear to
be labouring under the delusion that a reconciliation has taken place
of late between Religion and Science, and that the voice of the Higher
Criticism has been hushed&mdash;at least, they are continually assuring
us to this effect. They remain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href=
"#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>under this delusion for two reasons.
First, because they are more or less ignorant of science and of the
preponderating opinion of the scientific world concerning the truth of
Christianity. Secondly, because they are lulled into a feeling of
security through misconceptions regarding the attitude of the laity.
There appears to be the same, or nearly the same, average of religious
conformity as heretofore, and the consensus of opinion seems to be all
on the side of church and chapel. Any falling off in religious fervour
is attributed to sheer carelessness rather than to unbelief. From the
days of Huxley until quite lately there have been no attacks upon
Christianity worth mentioning. The Churches fail to realise that this
religious conformity and goodwill towards the Christian faith has
generally no connection whatever with a conviction of the truth of
Christianity, and that, where there is this conviction, it is usually
among those who are ignorant of the chief causes for suspicion. I
propose, therefore, in the first instance, to examine some of the more
usual types among the laity. Obviously, in doing so I shall be omitting
a great many shades of thought. I shall say very little about the
opinions of the genuine believer or of the hopelessly thoughtless, and
nothing of the opinions of evil-livers. My object is to set forth the
types which are most likely to have been misunderstood by the
clergy.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 2. <i>The Attitude of the Laity.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us commence, then, with the sceptical. <i>They are
not inclined, for the present at least, to propagate their views.</i>
Rightly or wrongly, they still hold the popular opinion that, while
they themselves can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>dispense with belief, the masses cannot. All
that is asked of a &ldquo;cultured&rdquo; man is that he keep his
opinion to himself. He may be an agnostic or&mdash;whether he realises
it or not&mdash;practically an atheist; but he must not think of
calling himself by such ugly names. &ldquo;The uneducated
freethinker,&rdquo; our modern philosopher will say, &ldquo;manifests a
Philistine Voltaireanism&mdash;a spirit now disapproved by scholars and
philosophers, who regard with serious consideration all the
manifestations and products of human thought, from the earliest
fetichism to the most recent developments of that religious tendency
which appears to be a constitutional element in man.&rdquo; Such high
thoughts, according to this philosopher, are not for the common herd,
who must continue to wallow in their ignorance, feeding on husks,
which, however unsuitable for his own refined digestion, will serve
well enough to nourish the religious instincts of the masses.</p>
<p>If of a mystical turn of mind, he will tell you that Christianity,
like all other religions, may be but a symbol of a great Reality; and
this person, though sceptical regarding the Christian dogmas, will
possibly consider himself a Christian. Or, again, he may be without any
leaning towards mysticism, and merely hold that religion, <i>if
sincere</i>, is better for the mind than scepticism. &ldquo;Better a
belated and imperfect religion,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;than none at
all. The heart has its claims on our consideration as well as the
intellect. Study Comte&rsquo;s <i>General View of
Positivism</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many agnostics are just as firmly convinced as believers that their
country&rsquo;s prosperity is bound up with the Christian belief. This
is largely due to their still clinging to the Church&rsquo;s teaching
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>concerning belief and morals. It is well to
remember, however, that the feeling on this point of the average
cultured Frenchman or Italian is quite the opposite. The measures now
being taken by the French Government against the clergy are based upon
the contention that the Church&rsquo;s influence is injurious to the
State&rsquo;s welfare; and this feeling has reached such a pitch that
Republican employees hardly dare admit their attendance at divine
worship. During September, 1904, the Italian Government extended a
cordial welcome to a Freethought Congress, and the proceedings were
opened by the Minister of Public Instruction. But the average
Englishman, be he ever so sure of the falsity of the Christian dogmas,
can foresee nothing but immorality and anarchy as the result of the
overthrow of Christianity. &ldquo;<i lang="la">Cui bono?</i>&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i lang="la">Quo vadis?</i>&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Leave well
alone!&rdquo; &ldquo;It is easy enough to show that Christianity is
false, but what have you to put in its place? What we want now is
construction, not criticism and the flogging of a dying creed.&rdquo;
He forgets, it seems to me, that people cannot be hoodwinked for ever,
and that, as Mr. Froude tells us, the Reformation was brought about by
people refusing any longer to believe a lie. In addition to this
concern for the public weal, the sceptic is influenced by motives of
expediency. He is well aware of the odium he would incur should he
proclaim his heterodox views concerning the popular religion. Such
publicity might spoil his professional career, be the death-blow of his
ambitions, cause him considerable pecuniary loss, alienate the friends
he most values, and, worst of all, destroy the happiness of his home
life. For these and similar reasons we find, in the case of the
half-believer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>that he does not care to verify his doubts, but
prefers to leave his opinions vague enough to be able to call himself a
broad-minded Christian. Whether half-believing or distinctly agnostic,
he usually holds that very common opinion regarding women, children,
and religion&mdash;that, however little store a man may set by belief,
it is wise to encourage it in the women folk, and also to hand over the
children to them for their religious instruction. Besides, militant
agnosticism is not the fashion. It is looked upon as &ldquo;bad
form,&rdquo; or as smacking of socialism. Indifference is much the
easier attitude.</p>
<p>Or, again, the average man is disposed to trust to the progress of
science and the ultimate triumph of truth, and sees no reason why he
should make any effort towards shortening the period of transition. In
his contempt for the efforts of the &ldquo;lowly born&rdquo; and
indigent secularists, he forgets that the greatest changes in the
world&rsquo;s history have been brought about from the smallest
beginnings by these very &ldquo;lower orders&rdquo; he affects to
despise. In our own times, was it not working men who first set in
motion a revolution that will eventually reform Russia? Perhaps the
commonest attitude of &ldquo;the man in the street,&rdquo; whatever his
manner of belief may be, is one of good-natured indifference&mdash;an
acquiescence in things as they are. Absence of the critical spirit or
of anxious-mindedness, or of both, renders it easy for him to take
things as he finds them, much after the manner of his primeval
ancestors. His mind will not occupy itself with aught but the present.
Naturally, too, he feels very strongly that what appears to make others
happy should not be disturbed. In all this he makes various
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>questionable assumptions, which I am considering
in subsequent chapters of this book.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to refer to the opinions of the militant agnostic,
as this type could never be accused of deceiving the Church. However,
it maybe noted that Mr. Blatchford says, in the <i>Clarion</i> of
February 3rd, 1905: &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, I attacked
religion because I believe it to be untrue, and because it seems to me
to bar the way to liberty and happiness. The attack upon religion is a
part of a task I have set myself.&rdquo; There are statesmen and other
persons of influence who are as incredulous as Mr. Blatchford regarding
the truth of Christianity; but they do not, apparently, hold that
Christianity bars the way to liberty and happiness (I give them credit
for being ruled by the highest motives), and so the Church has their
support. It is a weird arrangement between Unbelief and Belief, which
cannot possibly last much longer; meanwhile, it tends to confuse and
delay the answer to that gravest of questions: &ldquo;Is Christianity
true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the sceptic, let us examine another extremely common
type&mdash;the man who is under the impression that he is a Christian,
without either being particularly devout or having inquired at all
deeply into the grounds of his faith. He is ignorant of the causes for
doubt, because he has not had, or has not cared to afford, any time for
such matters. I do not refer so much to the masses, who obviously have
very little leisure, but to the more leisured and influential classes.
Such a man&rsquo;s scientific education, if he ever had any, was broken
off early in life. A large proportion of those all-important years of
his boyhood were devoted probably to an unwilling study of the
&ldquo;humanities.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>His faith is decidedly vague, and
according to his own peculiar interpretation, an adjustment between his
heavenly aspirations and his earthly inclinations. It has never been
thought out, and is not the result of a thorough study of its tenets.
He was born and bred a Christian, and all the nicest people he knows
are Christians, or he thinks they are. He is, all unconsciously, a
social chameleon taking his colour from the conditions in the midst of
which he happens to live. He, too, like his heterodox brother, sneers
at organised Freethought in this country, because it owes its inception
and conduct chiefly to poor and lowly men, forgetting that it was from
such a source that the mighty creed of Christendom itself arose. He
forgets that the first Christian apostles were mostly working men. If
he has heard or read anything of a sceptical nature, he has never
stopped to inquire any further into it. He has no idea that the central
features of the Bible have been attacked by men of the greatest
learning and integrity, with the result that even the defenders of the
faith ask for a reverent agnosticism as to the historical circumstances
out of which, in the first instance, belief in the resurrection of
Jesus Christ arose.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1551src" href=
"#xd21e1551" name="xd21e1551src">7</a> Not knowing that the essentials
are called in question, he sees no reason to trouble himself about mere
details. It is enough for him that he feels sure that there must be
some object in our existence, and that there must be a First Cause. It
never occurs to him to consider whether his and the Christian
conception of God can be reconciled. For him the truth of the Christian
dogma is proved sufficiently by the unsatisfying nature of materialism.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>Has he not been taught that he must have faith,
and that faith is a feeling of trust divinely implanted, and not
needing to be fed on evidences? Is not Christianity the civilising
agent of the world, and the origin of all morality and all good works?
Does not scepticism lead to atheism? If thought only leads to disbelief
in God, he for one is not going to think.</p>
<p>In addition to the now fast dwindling band of sincere and thoughtful
Christians there are, of course, many professing religionists who do
think a little, a very little, on religious subjects; but the bulk of
the male element are absolutely indifferent to the question of religion
at all. The average subaltern is as good a sample of the latter type as
any other. Speak to him about religion, and he is unutterably bored. A
certain amount of church-going forms part of his ordinary round of
duties. This is the sum-total of his &ldquo;religious
experiences.&rdquo; For the rest, religion, or any question as to its
truth in this or that particular, is, so far as he is concerned, a
matter of supreme indifference.</p>
<p>People are usually (though less so now perhaps than formerly) so
careful to keep their thoughts about religion to themselves that it is
no wonder the Church is ignorant of the extent to which heterodoxy is
rife. The colossal hypocrisy which speaks of &ldquo;the reserve of
Englishmen about their religion&rdquo; needs exposure. Why should there
be this dislike to talk upon religion&mdash;a religion which, if true,
should make all worldly affairs sink into infinitesimal insignificance?
Is it from a spirit of reverence, or is it not rather because the
interpretations of God&rsquo;s alleged revelation differ so widely that
people neither wish to &ldquo;give themselves away&rdquo; by stating
their own interpretations, nor to hear <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>the distasteful
interpretations of others? If they were perfectly straightforward, they
would run the danger both of hurting the feelings and falling in the
estimation of their friends.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a dread of appearing ridiculous, sometimes a
dislike of appearing to cant. Yet surely, if we believe what we
profess, there is nothing to be ashamed of, and we ought openly to
testify to our faith. I can speak from personal experience when I say
that the believing heathen of India, whether Hindoos, Mussulmans, or
Parsees, have no qualms on this score. They see no necessity for
&ldquo;reserve&rdquo; in the profession of their faith. They testify to
it openly at all times and in all places. It forms, as it ought, an
integral part of their every-day life.</p>
<p>This so-called &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; is also occasioned by the
inability to live up to the ethical ideals demanded by our creed. Men
wish neither to be hypocrites nor to be thought hypocrites. It is an
inherent fault in Christian ethics that certain portions are not
practicable. They are too much dominated by a belief in the near
approach of the end of the world. &ldquo;If we mechanically applied, as
rules of conduct, Christ&rsquo;s ideals of temper, we are certain, from
common sense, that universal pauperism, lawlessness, and national
extinction would follow.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1566src"
href="#xd21e1566" name="xd21e1566src">8</a> Then, again, there is too
much of the presumption that all men have an equal chance in the battle
against temptations, and too little acknowledgment of the part played
by heredity and environment; and thus the root of the evil is
overlooked. Also, if we have a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>strong &ldquo;conviction of
sin,&rdquo; which, according to our spiritual advisers, is essential,
and if we cannot hope to shake off the burden of sin by our own unaided
endeavours, our moral fibre is liable to be weakened, and we may cease
to cultivate the all-important qualities of self-reliance and
self-respect. Emerson&rsquo;s advice is far healthier: &ldquo;The less
we have to do with our sins the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the many causes of this &ldquo;proud reserve&rdquo; may be,
one of the consequences is that we remain in ignorance of our
neighbour&rsquo;s beliefs. If people discussed religious matters among
themselves, they would make some surprising discoveries. The agnostic
would find that &ldquo;believers&rdquo; are not the hypocrites he
sometimes puts them down to be, for he would learn, to his surprise,
that they are supremely ignorant of much that he assumed they would be
sure to know. The believer would find that there are many more
agnostics than he had ever dreamt there were, and he would also learn
that their reason for abandoning belief was of a very different nature
from what he had supposed.</p>
<p>When agnostics read the lessons in church, as they frequently do,
and when, with their aid and the aid of others in various stages of
heterodoxy, congregations in church and chapel on Sunday only amount to
twenty-two per cent.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1579src" href=
"#xd21e1579" name="xd21e1579src">9</a> of the population, and these
chiefly women,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1582src" href="#xd21e1582"
name="xd21e1582src">10</a> what must not be the sum-total of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>agnosticism, heterodoxy, and indifference among
<i>men</i> in this most Christian of nations? The extent of unavowed or
unconscious scepticism far exceeds that which is openly avowed or
consciously felt. Laxity in keeping the Sabbath is now notoriously on
the increase. Nothing can be more sensible than that people who have
slaved for six days in the atmosphere of the office, etc., should go
off for their &ldquo;week end&rsquo;s&rdquo; golf, etc.; but for the
clergy to attribute the consequent falling-off in church attendance
solely to the extra facilities of travel tempting people to
carelessness about religion is to adopt the method of the proverbial
ostrich in the desert at the approach of a dreaded enemy. Unbelief and
the advance of rationalism are really at the bottom of this new
development; for all the carelessness, all the temptations in the
world, would not persuade sane people to throw away their claims to
eternal happiness by neglecting to worship their God&mdash;a God that
<i>demands</i> this worship. How little do the clergy really know, or
attempt to know, of the beliefs of the cultured portion of their
congregations! As I write these words I receive, curiously enough, a
letter which shows how unusual it is for the pastor to question his
flock. The writer of the letter, a lady, says: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mr. X
(the rector of a certain country parish) a <i>gauche</i> man? Mr. Z (an
influential parishioner) didn&rsquo;t go to Holy Communion, and so Mr.
X asked him if he had been confirmed. Since then Mr. Z goes elsewhere
to church.&rdquo; Now, personally, I admire X&rsquo;s courage. What he
did <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>would not be done by the ordinary run of parsons.
If they did that sort of thing, they would soon become exceedingly
unpopular in the neighbourhood, and lose most of their fashionable and
opulent congregation. But they would begin to learn the true state of
affairs. They would learn, for instance, that some of the most regular
and respectable of the male portion of their congregations were
agnostic or heterodox, and that their attendance at divine worship was
merely to set a good example to the &ldquo;lower orders,&rdquo; or to
please their women-folk, or for some cause or other utterly unconnected
with any desire to worship or any belief in the efficacy of so doing.
There is doubtless a great deal to be said in favour of a spirit of
toleration which inculcates non-interference with a man&rsquo;s belief;
but it all helps to hide the true state of affairs, and is surely
overdone when it encourages men to attend a service where they are
acting a part and making solemn declarations untruthfully.</p>
<p>There is one more type of person I should include among the many
strange buttresses of the Church&mdash;namely, the person who refuses
point blank to be enlightened. The Churches have been lulled into a
sense of security by many causes, but chief among them, perhaps, there
stands out the fact that people not only will not take the trouble to
inquire into the grounds of their faith, but consider that it would be
positively wicked to do any such thing. To such I can only repeat the
words of the Rev. J. W. Diggle, now Bishop of Carlisle. &ldquo;There
are,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;perhaps, few things, and certainly nothing
of similar moment, about which men give themselves so little trouble,
and take such little pains, as the ascertainment, by strict
examination, of the foundations and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>the evidences of their religion.
Hence so many religious persons are like children who have not learned
things accurately. They are fearful of being questioned, and are out of
temper in an examination.&rdquo; However, as an excuse for this
timidity&mdash;for it is often nothing else&mdash;it must be conceded
that a deep study of the evidences does, more often than not, end in
agnosticism. This gives rise to the serious question: &ldquo;If it is
God who assists us to remain staunch to our creed, why does He so often
forsake us, just when we are trying to lead more thoughtful lives and,
consequently, study more deeply the faith we profess?&rdquo; On the one
hand, we find that modern agnosticism is not the result of
carelessness, but of thoughtfulness. On the other hand, we observe that
the Church numbers among some of its firmest adherents not only those
who are ignorant through circumstances over which they have no control,
or through thoughtlessness, but also those who remain ignorant through
fear to inquire.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 3. <i>Christianity and Science not
Reconciled.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Has the Church, then, been deceived in her impression
that a reconciliation has taken place between Christianity and Science?
Most certainly. I grant that to some extent there exists a patched-up
peace. The modern apologist no longer adopts the unwise course of
maintaining every strange phenomenon to be miraculous as long as it is
unexplained, whereby each advance of physical science used necessarily
to be hostile to theology. He even goes further, and says that the
Resurrection and all the miracles may be only the manifestation of some
law which is as yet beyond the analysis of our short experience. But,
as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>I shall show later on, the new interpretations
tone down hostility in one respect only to raise fresh and greater
difficulties in another.</p>
<p>The manner in which misunderstandings occur on the subject of a
reconciliation is well seen when we look into one of the Church&rsquo;s
most popular arguments in its favour&mdash;the appeal to the
pronouncement by Lord Kelvin in support of a Creative Power. Lord
Kelvin assured the world that modern biologists were &ldquo;coming to
the belief in the existence of a vital principle.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1619src" href="#xd21e1619" name=
"xd21e1619src">11</a> That this pronouncement raised a perfect storm of
protest in the world of science is wholly ignored by the world of
religion. Suppose, however, that the consensus of opinion had been
otherwise, what conclusion could we draw? We simply obtain an argument
for some form of Theism. The probability of the existence of a Creative
Power would not in itself prove the truth of the Christian dogmas,
although it would be a very necessary link in the chain of evidence. It
is extremely doubtful whether any scientist or philosopher really holds
the doctrine of a personal God, certainly not of the anthropomorphic
God of Christianity. Let us take Sir Oliver Lodge, for example. He is
continually being held up to us by the Church as an instance of a man
of science who finds himself able to believe in the supernatural; but
does the Church claim him as one of her fold? In the <i>Hibbert
Journal</i> for April, 1904, he makes out a strong case for the entire
re-interpretation of the Christian doctrine, in which, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>among
other dogmas, the Atonement and Virgin-birth are completely
surrendered. He has never yet professed belief in a personal God, and
seems to question His omnipotence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1627src"
href="#xd21e1627" name="xd21e1627src">12</a> Again, in a paper which he
contributed lately to a book of essays entitled <i>Ideals of
Science</i>, he owns that science is a long way from actively
supporting religion. In spite of this, no name is, or used to be, more
frequently quoted than his, in support of the Church&rsquo;s contention
that a reconciliation has taken place.</p>
<p>The admissions of Sir Oliver Lodge are, in a certain sense, all the
more important because he undoubtedly is one of the few men of science
who still retain a strong belief in a spiritual world. In the
<i>Hibbert Journal</i> for January, 1905, he informs us that he is
opposed to a materialistic monism, such as Haeckel&rsquo;s, and that
&ldquo;the progress of thought has left him [Haeckel], as well as his
great English exemplar, Herbert Spencer, somewhat high and dry, belated
and stranded by the tide of opinion which has now begun to flow in
another direction.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1641src" href=
"#xd21e1641" name="xd21e1641src">13</a> This is the sort of statement
which is eagerly seized upon by the Church; but it neither witnesses to
the truth of Christianity, nor does it voice the opinion of the
scientific world. It is the opinion of a scientist who believes that he
has had &ldquo;communication with spirits.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1647src" href="#xd21e1647" name="xd21e1647src">14</a> Professor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>Ray Lankester, one of our leading biologists in
England, indignantly refutes Sir Oliver&rsquo;s strictures on Professor
Haeckel.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1655src" href="#xd21e1655" name=
"xd21e1655src">15</a></p>
<p>Now, it is, of course, quite true that there are schools of thought
opposed to Haeckel&rsquo;s. There is, for instance, the school which
considers that science has no business to concern herself with
theology; and there are the metaphysicians. But the point I wish to
make clear is that all these schools are heterodox. They do not accept
the Christian dogmas. It is so easy for false impressions on such
matters to get about, and, I regret to add, this does not occur
altogether by chance. When Haeckel, one of our greatest living
biologists, was caught tripping in his knowledge of theology by a
professor of that subject, the Church explained to the laity that the
great Dr. Loofs had shown that Haeckel had forfeited his claim to
consideration as a reliable man of science; and, on this basis, his
<i>Riddle of the Universe</i> was held up to obloquy and derision. The
Church, however, did not mention at the same time that Haeckel had
expressly said that he was not skilled in theology, and that it was
only in his own branch of knowledge that he spoke with authority. Nor
did the Church mention that their champion, the learned theologian, Dr.
Loofs, himself discredits the notion of the Virgin-birth, and that the
chief bone of contention between the two professors was simply the
question of the parentage of Jesus.</p>
<p>It is just because science and religion <i>are</i> in conflict that
the religious naturally wish to discredit science. They will, if they
are sufficiently ignorant, go so far <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>as Lady Blount,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1673src" href="#xd21e1673" name=
"xd21e1673src">16</a> and hold that the earth is flat and without
motion. But such persons should note that in the Church itself there
are a few&mdash;the few best qualified to form an opinion&mdash;who
accept all the main facts of science, and do not think, or pretend that
they think, that there has been any reconciliation. The Rev. P. N.
Waggett is one of these. He is an apologist of unusual scientific
competence, and his new handbook for the clergy, <i>Religion and
Science</i>, simply bristles with problems which he confesses have yet
to be solved. However, he does not allow himself to be disturbed.
Conclusions adverse to theology are to be resisted. In other words, we
must possess our souls in patience until we can see a way out of our
difficulties. He remarks: &ldquo;There are conclusions which are to be
dissolved, and conclusions which are to be avoided; but there are also
conclusions which have to be resisted, held at bay&mdash;&lsquo;held
up,&rsquo; I think some adventurous Western people call it&mdash;until
we can see our way to destroy them. Such a resistance is not
irrational.&rdquo; He personally prefers &ldquo;the positive or
scientific treatment and pursuit of religion,&rdquo; and he goes on to
say that &ldquo;this positive pursuit of the facts of the spirit must
be maintained in spite of difficulties. It must be maintained in spite
of outstanding discrepancies with science.&rdquo; To my mind, the
position here taken up by Mr. Waggett is the only possible one for a
convinced Christian who has a real knowledge of science. He avoids the
snares into which so many of his fellow clerics have fallen. For he
does not jump at the conclusion that every &ldquo;gap&rdquo; in our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>knowledge of life&rsquo;s mysteries is a proof of
the supernatural. Nor does he attempt to show, as many other apologists
are wont to do, that there is no direct connection between science and
religion. He does not try to escape the criticism of metaphysical
conclusions which a scientific habit of thought engenders. But, while
his position may appear at first sight a tenable one, whether it be so
or not depends entirely upon the correctness of the assumption on which
his argument is really based&mdash;the true witness of the heart, as
against the false witness of the reason. It is interesting to compare
Mr. Waggett&rsquo;s position with that of another of the progressives.
The Rev. John Kelman writes in <i>Ideals of Science and
Faith</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1684src" href="#xd21e1684" name=
"xd21e1684src">17</a>: &ldquo;So far as we have gone, the history of
the past, viewed by the light in which the newer conceptions of the
Bible have placed it, shows that, at the present moment in the progress
of thought, science and religion are not in the least degree at strife.
They need no reconciliation.&rdquo; Suppose the Rev. J. Kelman to be
right and the Rev. P. N. Waggett to be wrong, what then? It is the
<i>newer</i> conceptions of the Bible which make it possible for Mr.
Kelman to speak of a reconciliation&mdash;the very conceptions which
the orthodox cannot and will not accept. The orthodox believer is told
that religion and science are reconciled; but he is not told by what
means. Thus the orthodox, who would never think of accepting the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>&ldquo;terribly heterodox&rdquo; ideas of the
advanced school, are all the time accepting a result which could only
be arrived at by the help of those self-same ideas. In fact, it was the
very necessity for a reconciliation which originated their
invention.</p>
<p>So much is said about &ldquo;scientific doubt&rdquo; in these days
that it is well to remember that doubts as to the truth of the
Christian belief are not caused alone by purely scientific difficulties
of faith. Carlyle refused to accept Darwin&rsquo;s theories. His
temperament was strongly inclined to a stern Puritanical piety, and his
whole nature was antipathetic to science. Yet he did not think it
possible that &ldquo;educated honest men could profess much longer to
believe in historical Christianity.&rdquo; Renan, a profound scholar in
Oriental languages, shows, in his famous work, <i>The Life of
Jesus</i>, that, while keenly appreciative of all that was beautiful in
the life and teaching of Jesus, he was forced, by his study of the
Scriptures<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1697src" href="#xd21e1697" name=
"xd21e1697src">18</a> in the original, to the conclusion that the
miraculous part of the narrative had no historical foundation. Leo
Tolstoi, the helper of the helpless, whose voice is ever raised in the
cause of universal love and peace, vainly sought an answer to religious
doubts, and finally renounced Christian dogmas, building up a religion
of his own. Numerous instances could be given showing that well-known
and pious-minded thinkers have rejected Christianity on grounds other
than scientific. And this diversity in the reasons for negation further
tends to strengthen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>those suspicions regarding our faith which it
is now the apologist&rsquo;s task to dispel.</p>
<p>A significant circumstance is the far more tolerant attitude of the
better-informed clergy towards the unbeliever. There still remain
persons of the Dr. Torrey and the Rev. J. Morgan Gibbon<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1710src" href="#xd21e1710" name=
"xd21e1710src">19</a> type, ready to vilify the agnostic; but their
number is rapidly on the decrease. The clergy, as a whole, are more
tolerant now than many of the pious laity. Why is this? Is it not
because they are beginning to appreciate the perplexities of faith, and
to learn that agnostics as a body can be, and are, good men? Under
certain conditions they themselves have severe wrestlings with the
dictates of reason, and it is only by prayer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1716src" href="#xd21e1716" name="xd21e1716src">20</a> and
occupying their minds in their work that they are able to dispel dark
doubts. They will tell you that a faith such as theirs, and such as
they hope you will attain after emergence from doubt, is a real faith,
with which the faith of the ordinary person, accepting everything on
trust, is not to be compared.</p>
<p>It is all very well to talk glibly, as so many do nowadays, of an
age of tolerance. How can <i>man</i> be tolerant in matters concerning
which <i>God</i> is alleged to have distinctly told us that He is not
tolerant? It has often occurred to me that, were there such a person as
the Devil, he must be much puzzled over the case of the high-minded
agnostic, and more especially so if the latter conceived it his duty to
propagate his views. In other words, if he were a militant
agnostic&mdash;a Huxley or a Holyoake. For, on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>the one
hand, if the Devil could persuade the agnostic to adopt religious
conformity at the expense of self-respect, he would ruin the
agnostic&rsquo;s character, and so drag one more soul into perdition;
but he would at the same time be rendering the whole Christian
community a service by saving them from the dangerous advice of the
agnostic. On the other hand, if Satan aided the agnostic in the line of
conduct which he was at present conscientiously pursuing, the soul of
the latter would slip from Satan&rsquo;s grasp (for I presume there can
be no punishment for honesty); but, as Anti-Christ, Satan would reap a
grand harvest from the seeds of unbelief sown by the agnostic. And the
purer and more unselfish the life of the agnostic, the more the latter
would influence people to share his opinions. How does God view this
perplexing situation? We are told from the pulpit nowadays, by the
broader-minded parson, not only that agnostics may be good men, but
that they &ldquo;exhibit the very temper which Christ
blesses.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1729src" href="#xd21e1729"
name="xd21e1729src">21</a> This curious truce between Believer and
Unbeliever, each still holding fast to his belief or unbelief, only
serves to demonstrate with added force that there is not, and cannot
be, a reconciliation between Faith and Knowledge.</p>

Outburst.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is imperative that the Churches should appreciate
the real character of the new outburst of scepticism. The controversy
with rationalism has entered upon another phase&mdash;a phase far more
dangerous to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>security of Christendom. As was inevitable, the
suspicions regarding the faith have filtered down to classes that are
not content to be duped because, forsooth, it is said to be for their
good. They have none of the reasons of the upper-class agnostic for
&ldquo;lying low.&rdquo; The enlightenment of the working man has been
accelerated during the past year or so by the issue of cheap reprints
from the books of our great scientists and thinkers, and by a direct
attack upon religion by the well-known editor of the <i>Clarion</i>,
Robert Blatchford. That the Churches are already partly alive to the
new danger is evinced by their present anxious attitude towards the
spread of knowledge likely to be damaging to the Faith. It was one of
the subjects discussed at the Canterbury Diocesan Conference in June,
1904, and will, doubtless, be earnestly discussed at the next Church
Congress, together with the whole question of the rapid increase in
unbelief. While, however, the Church inveighs against the
&ldquo;reprints,&rdquo; she gives out, also, that &ldquo;Christianity
is always strengthened by being attacked.&rdquo; This is hardly
consistent. For why not, then, allow the process of strengthening to
continue by these means? Certainly, <i>if</i> Christianity be true, the
Church ought to be strengthened. How could it be otherwise? It might
compel her to discard some of her dogmas; but that would only be if
they were false, and, in such case, she is better without them. Nothing
but good should arise from a thorough examination of her tenets. She
would be enabled to find out where her weakness lies, and thus to
emerge from the ordeal stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Those who wish, as I do, to learn the whole truth concerning
Christianity, hope that she will no longer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>postpone
a complete and unbiassed investigation of the whole of the
anti-Christian arguments. Doubtless we shall get our wish in time; but
meanwhile we deplore the delay, for reasons I have more particularly
set forth in the concluding chapter of this book. If the honest truth
be that she is not confident of the security of her position, are we to
understand that the cause of Untruth is thought to be more likely to
prosper than the cause of Truth?</p>
<p>Of the two conflicting views regarding the effect of anti-Christian
attacks&mdash;the pessimistic and the optimistic&mdash;it is the former
which appears to me the more likely to be correct. For consider what
would occur should attacks of far greater severity be delivered&mdash;a
contingency by no means impossible in the near future. Suppose the
&ldquo;rational&rdquo; propagandists, instead of being hampered by the
want of funds and influential support, were to become endowed with a
fraction of the wealth of the Church, and were thus in a position to
popularise their views by spending money in extensive advertisement of
every description, by subsidising platform orators who would propound
rationalism and non-theological ethics in every town and village, by
relieving distress, and so on, would the Christian Faith be
strengthened? Has it not already suffered since the sixpenny reprints
began to bring knowledge within the reach of the people&mdash;the
people who have, many of them, little or nothing to fear from an
expression of their agnosticism? If militant rationalists were
sufficiently possessed of this world&rsquo;s goods to start an adequate
fund for the lucrative employment of clergymen who find they can no
longer subscribe to the articles of the Christian Faith, and who would
leave the Church if they could do so without having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>to face
absolute ruin, would not the secessions increase in direct proportion
to the increase of the fund and the consequent means of
support?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1755src" href="#xd21e1755" name=
"xd21e1755src">22</a> If those men of note who are even now agnostics
at heart were to proclaim the fact and assist in propagandism, would
not the flock follow the bell-wethers?</p>
<p>Whether hastened or not by the action of the propagandist, the
masses, in these days of universal education, are bound to hear sooner
or later of these grave doubts. The questioners of the Faith are no
longer only the philosophers, scientists, and those who join hands with
the Churches in prescribing a dietary of fairy tales for the
preservation of the moral health of the masses. Many of the working
class<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1760src" href="#xd21e1760" name=
"xd21e1760src">23</a> are far more thoughtful and intelligent regarding
questions of science as it affects religion than is generally supposed.
Hitherto they have been under two very considerable
disadvantages&mdash;the costliness of the books and the want of leisure
to read them. The leisure disability still holds good, though less so
now that temperance is on the increase; but the books are to-day
offered at popular prices, and are also finding their way into public
libraries. The Church can, perhaps, depend for some time to come upon
the non-interference and even active support of the upper classes,
however sceptical they may be; but it is the proletariat which she will
in future have to deal with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>more and more. She is in a dilemma;
her hand is forced. She realises that discussion will cause the
unsettlement of minds hitherto unclouded by doubt, and yet matters have
reached a stage when silence is impossible. It is doubtful whether she
has yet fully realised the gravity of the task before her. I have
explained how she seems to have been deceived as to the real meaning of
the apparent suspension of hostilities during the past few years. She
has also to learn how impossible it will be for the ordinary mind to
accept the unconvincing and contradictory expositions of the Faith
which are now offered to us under the title of Christian
apologetics.</p>

Wanting.&rdquo;</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The time, then, has arrived when the pastor can no
longer ignore or gloze over the thoughts that are stirring the minds of
the intelligent portion of his flock. The cheap literature problem
cannot be solved by applying disparaging adjectives, such as
&ldquo;shallow,&rdquo; to writings emanating from the pens of Darwin,
Huxley, Tyndall, S. Laing, Matthew Arnold, Sir Leslie Stephen, Renan,
Haeckel, etc., easy though it be to excite prejudice by the use of a
condemnatory adjective. Books that are still costly will some day be
available at popular prices, and increase the perplexities of the
people. I refer to books of the type of Lecky&rsquo;s <i>Rise and
Influence of Rationalism in Europe</i>, Buckle&rsquo;s <i>History of
Civilisation in England</i>, Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i>,
Forlong&rsquo;s <i>Short Studies of the Science of Comparative
Religions</i>, Doane&rsquo;s <i>Bible Myths and their Parallels in
other Religions</i>, J. M. Robertson&rsquo;s <i>Christianity and
Mythology</i> and <i>Pagan Christs</i>, Spencer&rsquo;s <i>Principles
of Sociology</i> (Vol. I., Part I., <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30"
href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>giving the Data of Sociology),
Metchnikoff&rsquo;s <i>The Nature of Man</i>, Haeckel&rsquo;s <i>The
Evolution of Man</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1806src" href=
"#xd21e1806" name="xd21e1806src">24</a> etc. Will not the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i>, with a title so innocent, and with
an editor and many of its contributors in Holy Orders, soon find its
way into our public libraries and be a thorn in the side of the
orthodox? Think how a book such as Nunquam&rsquo;s (Robert Blatchford)
<i>God and My Neighbour</i> must already have been read by and have
affected the convictions of thousands of the working class. And the
grave doubts of a hard-headed artisan are not in the least likely to be
dispelled by <i>Anti-Nunquam</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1818src"
href="#xd21e1818" name="xd21e1818src">25</a> or any of the literature
so far published as a panacea &ldquo;in relief of
doubt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1826src" href="#xd21e1826"
name="xd21e1826src">26</a> Indeed, some apologetic works are enough in
themselves to create mistrust, though the reader had not read a single
anti-Christian work! The extraordinary divergence in the views of the
authors, to say nothing of the transparency of some of their arguments,
prevents all chance of apologetics convincing any but those already
determined to be convinced. The writer in one stage of thought
absolutely contradicts a writer in another stage. Compare Goulburn and
Pusey in their awful assertions of everlasting punishment with
Allin&rsquo;s <i>Universalism Asserted</i> and <i>Larger Hope</i>
leaflets, or the views of a Wace regarding Evolution with the views of
a Waggett. If we confine ourselves to making comparisons only between
the advanced thinkers themselves, compare <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>the opinions of Dr. Gore,
Bishop of Birmingham (late of Worcester), with those of Canons Henson
and Cheyne. The deplorable state of religious apologetics is becoming
notorious, and articles bearing on the subject are now appearing from
time to time in our leading magazines.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1838src" href="#xd21e1838" name="xd21e1838src">27</a></p>
<p>In defending the Faith the advanced school of the Church now frankly
admit the difficulties of the old belief, and ask us to accept their
new interpretations of Christianity. The older school of theologians,
the school who can bring themselves neither to assert the truth of
evolution nor to give a decided opinion on the verbal inspiration of
the Bible, are unwillingly, very unwillingly, beginning to follow in
their wake. The views of the two schools being in conflict on many
vital points, it is impossible that they can ever be brought into
agreement. Yet, unless concerted measures are soon taken, confusion
will be worse confounded. To add to the perplexity of the situation,
there are also the various views of the Nonconformists to be taken into
account. Then there are the Scottish Churches, having on the one side
the law-supported minority, standing for an infallible Bible and all
the doctrines of John Calvin; and, on the other, the majority standing
for a form of Christianity which is really Calvinism with a somewhat
unequally-applied veneer of Higher Criticism. Finally there is the
Irish Roman Catholic Church still sunk in the gross superstitions of
the Dark Ages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>The advanced school represent the section which is in close touch
with modern thought, so that their new interpretations of the Faith
constitute the one and only hope of arresting the advance of
agnosticism. On the other hand, the justice of the objections to these
new interpretations is borne out by the circumstance that many of the
older school would no more think of accepting them than they would of
giving up their belief; rather than accept them they prefer to deny the
facts of science. Both sides do violence to their reason&mdash;the
enlightened in using the subtleties of their intellect for
interpretations which appear transparently false alike to the orthodox
and to the unbeliever; the obscurantist in denying established facts.
Consider for a moment what all this means. It means that the modern
sceptic has the support of the strictly orthodox when he refutes the
only explanations as yet offered to dispel his doubts. It means that
the validity of the agnostic&rsquo;s objections to these new-fangled
interpretations is fully borne out by the common sense of Christians
themselves, and that a denial of the facts of science and of the
results of Biblical research is the only way we can escape from
unbelief. If a puzzled truth-seeker tried to take a middle course, he
would have to believe that black and white were the same colour, and
his belief would degenerate into an exceedingly unedifying grey. There
is a large proportion of this &ldquo;grey&rdquo; belief just now.</p>
<p>I cannot too strongly reiterate that this complete divergence in the
interpretation of a revelation alleged to have been vouchsafed by God
cannot but give rise to the most intense suspicion. The very word
&ldquo;apologetics&rdquo; is self-condemnatory. How is it that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>the claims of Christianity require all this
vindication? Heresies and schisms and the need for apologetics form the
constant note of Christian history from first to last. True there was a
lull in the questionings of the Faith; but that was during the Dark
Ages, when the priests adopted the policy of keeping the world in
ignorance, and of destroying all the evidences against Christianity
that they could lay their hands upon. If the events said to have
happened really happened, and if God wished the world to know of them,
why all this mystery, why the need for all these apologetics concerning
them? Which of the conflicting explanations are we to take as
correct?</p>
<p>The late Bishop of Durham, Dr. Westcott, in a passage in his book,
<i>Lessons from Work</i>, says: &ldquo;It would be easier if we might
divest ourselves of the divine prerogative of reason. It would be
easier, but would that be the life which Christ came down from heaven
to show us and place within our reach?&rdquo; It is not for me to
quarrel with so emphatic a pronouncement in favour of using our reason;
but such advice cannot be reconciled with the teaching of Christ or of
our own Church&mdash;that we should receive God&rsquo;s word as
&ldquo;babes.&rdquo; Remember those strange words attributed to Him:
&ldquo;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou
hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto
babes.&rdquo; From this one would gather that it was God&rsquo;s
pleasure to hide Himself from the wise, and therefore that the increase
of agnosticism alongside the spread of knowledge was all part of the
Divine plan. The Roman Catholic Church is more consistent. She obeys
the alleged teaching of Christ in this respect to the letter. The truth
is that when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>Jesus spoke these words, if He ever did speak
them, the vast majority of mankind were &ldquo;babes.&rdquo; His
disciples were &ldquo;babes&rdquo;; His enemies the more enlightened.
He did not foresee the advance of knowledge and the spread of
education. Nor did the Church anticipate this increase in
&ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo; or rather, I should say, she employed every
possible means to hinder it. If God&rsquo;s revelation may be
understood by babes, it must be very simple. How, then, do we find it
requiring all this explanation&mdash;explanation which no ordinary
adult can understand? Who could call modern theology simple? Can we say
that of our philosopher-Premier&rsquo;s books, <i>A Defence of
Philosophic Doubt</i> and <i>The Foundations of Belief</i>? Is it not
because the Church recognises that the masses will never understand all
these subtle explanations and pleas for a re-statement of Christianity
that she is in no hurry to impart the new ideas from the pulpit? Even
the more intellectual truthseeker is constantly recommended to trust
less to his reason, and &ldquo;to come to Christ as a little
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The objections of the more conservative to the new interpretations
of Christianity are well expressed in the solemn words of a former Dean
of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, himself inveighed against, in his day,
as somewhat of a freethinker. &ldquo;Many,&rdquo; writes Dean Mansell,
&ldquo;who would shrink with horror from the idea of rejecting Christ
altogether, will yet speak and act as if they were at liberty to set up
for themselves an eclectic Christianity, separating the essential from
the superfluous portions of Christ&rsquo;s teaching, deciding for
themselves how much is permanent and necessary for all men, and how
much is temporary and designed only for a particular age and people.
Yet if Christ is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>indeed God manifest in the Flesh, it is surely not
less impious to attempt to improve His teaching than to reject it
altogether. Nay, in one respect it is more so, for it is to acknowledge
a doctrine as the revelation of God, and, at the same time, to proclaim
that it is inferior to the wisdom of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Athanasian Creed controversy furnishes some striking examples of
both conservative and latitudinarian opinions. Dr. Pusey is related to
have said: &ldquo;If the Athanasian Creed is touched, I see nothing to
do but to give up my canonry.&rdquo; Yet we find the present Primate,
Dr. Randall Davidson, replying to a deputation of clergymen who desired
to be relieved from the obligation of reciting this Creed: &ldquo;I am
in complete sympathy with the object you have at heart.&rdquo;
Presumably he is in agreement with Dr. Barnes, Hulsean professor of
divinity, who, when lecturing lately at Cambridge on the Athanasian
Creed, declared that there was &ldquo;no authority in Scripture for its
minatory clauses.&rdquo; The well-meant attempt of the Dean of
Westminster to smooth down the asperities of the Creed by
<i>singing</i> instead of saying it, is typical of those pitiful
attempts to tide over difficulties which are now so much in evidence.
&ldquo;We make,&rdquo; says one of the old school, &ldquo;unsuitable
persons partakers of the Divine service of the Church, and then it is
proposed to alter the Divine service to suit them. Let honest
Unbelievers or Half-Believers absent themselves from the Assembly of
the Faithful, and let the Faithful worship faithfully.&rdquo; Yet, if
this line of conduct were put into practice, if the modern Origens were
anathematised and only those laymen admitted to Divine service who held
all the articles of the Christian faith without mental reservations of
any kind, every single advanced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>theologian would be degraded
from his office, and the present twenty-two per cent. who are church
and chapel-goers would be reduced to&mdash;what shall we say? Well, the
churches having cultured congregations would be almost empty. The
modern spirit of toleration, admirable as it is in many ways, assists
in preventing the discovery of the real truth of the matter. The Church
is grossly deceiving herself if she really thinks that the apparent
adherence of the majority of the well-to-do classes indicates that
burning suspicions of the Christian dogmas have been quenched by
Christian apologetics.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 6. <i>More Things which Confuse the
Issue.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the early part of this chapter I have alluded to
the real causes for the apparent acquiescence of the majority in the
claims of the Christian religion. Among these causes there is a
somewhat complex one requiring, special notice, for it tends to confuse
the main issue, more perhaps than any other. The Church is now
appearing in an altogether novel role. Until quite recently her concern
was only for the spiritual welfare of man, and she expected to gain her
purpose by supernatural rather than by natural means. This plan, after
many centuries of trial, has proved a terrible failure. It has not
contributed either to man&rsquo;s spiritual or material improvement.
Now, in England, she is emulating the thorough-paced humanitarian in
her devotion to the betterment of humanity by natural means. Never
before has there been that interest in the material condition of the
people which is now evinced by such institutions as the Church
Temperance Society and Homes for Inebriates, the Church Army, the
Church Lads <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>Brigade, the Church Rescue Societies, Homes for
Waifs and Strays, etc. The Church, too, is now concerning herself with
the better housing of the poor, the improvement of our jail system, and
other rational methods for raising the social condition of the people
and creating an environment likely to improve the moral atmosphere. All
such measures, in fact, as have long ago been advocated by rationalists
and social reformers are now taken up vigorously by the Churches.
&ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; you will say. Quite so; but that
is not the point. Far be it from me to decry these excellent results of
&ldquo;modern thought&rdquo;; still, the fact remains that the issue is
thereby confused, and will continue to be thus confused for some time
to come. People will only look at what the Churches, in Protestant
countries at least, are now doing, and see in it another proof of
Christianity&rsquo;s power for good. They will not trouble their heads
to consider why it should have taken nearly 2,000 years before the
Christian Church recognised such an essential portion of her duties
towards her poorer neighbours.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1888src"
href="#xd21e1888" name="xd21e1888src">28</a></p>
<p>Nor is it only this increase of zeal for &ldquo;raising humanity out
of the gutter&rdquo; which has confused the issue. Numerous are the
ways in which Christianity obtains a prestige sometimes partly
deserved, sometimes wholly undeserved. Good works belong to the former
class. The Churches of all denominations have always occupied the
position of grand almoners, and, in that they have carried out that
trust conscientiously, they have fully earned the confidence of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>the rich and the gratitude of the poor. But people
are liable to forget that the huge donations given during their
lifetime, and left in their wills by charitably disposed persons, are
given usually from true humanitarian principles, and that kind hearts
are to be found all over the world, quite apart from belief or
unbelief. These gifts to the needy are not, let it be said to the
credit of mankind, a mere soul-insurance, like the donations given, and
often extorted, in the Roman Catholic and Greek Churches, for
&ldquo;Masses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Indulgences,&rdquo; etc. All this
charitable work, for which the Church is the agent employed, is usually
put down entirely to the credit of the Church and Christianity. It does
not seem to be realised that the &ldquo;Golden Rule&rdquo; is far older
than Christianity, and is practised in other than Christian countries;
and that the Church, in being entrusted very largely with the
dispensation of charity, obtains credit for a service for which she is
after all well paid, and which any properly selected body of laymen
would perform quite as well, and possibly with more discrimination.</p>
<p>If all the good and none of the bad works performed in Christendom
are to be attributed to the working of the Christian faith, the same
argument must hold good of the Hindu or Buddhist faith, when the people
are Hindoos or Buddhists. The code of ethics attached to a religion
does, of course, make a difference; but it neither proves that the
belief is correct, nor that it is impossible to have the ethics without
the belief. Confucianism is an <i>agnostic</i> ethical system which the
<i>educated classes of Japan have adopted for centuries</i>, and its
splendid results are just now much in evidence. Only a few days ago I
received a letter from an agnostic supporter of Christianity who said:
&ldquo;Look <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>at the good that Christianity does, look at its
endless charitable organisations&rdquo;; and he asked, &ldquo;Could the
<i>Clarion</i> people do anything of this kind?&rdquo; It never
occurred to him, and it never occurs to many of his way of thinking,
that the &ldquo;<i>Clarion</i> people&rdquo; have very slender funds at
present; and the charitable work that they do, though proportionately
large, is not likely to come to his notice unless he takes the trouble
to inquire. The vast majority of English people are professing
Christians, and if any charitable work is to be done agnostics give
their support to it, although the agents for it are Christians.
However, I have not received a brief from the
&ldquo;Clarionettes.&rdquo; My object is to show how the issue becomes
confused, and, if my agnostic friend is correct in considering
Christianity false and yet indispensable, the future is indeed full of
alarms. What will happen, for instance, when the knowledge of this
falsehood becomes common property? I am fully aware that my friend
voices the opinion of many fairly thoughtful Englishmen; but this is
because they are in the habit of hearing every useful advance in
civilisation accredited to Christianity:&mdash;hospitals, though they
existed long before Christianity, and only fell out of use after its
introduction&mdash;the raised status of women, though it was on the
introduction of Christianity that the status was
lowered&mdash;abolition of slavery, though among the most strenuous
advocates for the abolition were such well-known freethinkers as Ralph
Waldo Emerson, John Stuart Mill, and Moncure Conway, while the whole of
Tory England shouted its approval when General Lee drew his sword on
behalf of the rights of &ldquo;Old Virginia,&rdquo; and while
Gladstone, in his first Newark address, 1832, owned that slavery was
justified by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>Bible&mdash;efforts for superseding the horrors
and clumsiness of war, though freethinkers to a man are supporters of
the movement, while Bishops from the pulpit offer up prayers for peace
and in the same breath expatiate on the ennobling effects of war upon
the race, and while the head of a mighty theocratic-autocratic
Christian Government calls the nations to a peace conference, and then
takes the first opportunity to prosecute the most unnecessary and
bloody war the world has ever known.</p>
<p>It is erroneous assertions such as these which tend, perhaps, more
than anything else, to confuse the simple question before us&mdash;the
truth of Christianity. They are therefore discussed at greater length
in a separate chapter devoted to popular fallacies. Meanwhile, in the
present chapter I hope I have succeeded in giving some insight into the
true nature of the present situation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">&sect; 1. <i>Preliminary Remarks.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this and the following chapters I hope to show how
matters stand with reference to the more important points at issue
between the Christian apologist and the Rationalist. The truth or
otherwise of the Bible miracles being of supreme importance, I begin
with an examination of the position of apologetics with regard to
them.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch2.1.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE VIEW OF SCIENCE.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Professor Huxley once made the following remark:
&ldquo;The miracles of the Church are child&rsquo;s play to the
miracles I see in nature.&rdquo; This has been hailed by the apologist
as a satisfactory admission that science concedes the possibility of
miracles. It is continually being quoted in apologetic works and from
the pulpit, and is apparently considered as a conclusive piece of
evidence that science has nothing to say against miracles. But,
Professor Huxley went on to explain: &ldquo;On the strength of an
undeniable improbability, however, we not only have a right to demand,
but are morally bound to require, strong evidence in favour of a
miracle before we even take it into serious consideration. But when,
instead of such evidence, nothing is produced but stories originating
nobody knows how or when, among persons who could firmly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>believe
in devils which enter pigs, I confess that my feeling is one of
astonishment that anyone should expect a reasonable man to take such
testimony seriously.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1943src" href=
"#xd21e1943" name="xd21e1943src">1</a> We never hear of this from the
pulpit! Possibly Professor Huxley would not have been thus
misrepresented&mdash;or shall we say misunderstood?&mdash;if he had
spoken of the <i>wonders</i> of nature, and had not used a word
popularly understood to signify that break in nature&rsquo;s laws which
it has yet to be proved has ever occurred, or can ever occur. The
wonders of nature take place in accordance with natural laws; miracles
do not.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch2.1.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">WHY HAVE MIRACLES CEASED?</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An obvious objection to miracles is the one often
propounded by an inquiring child, &ldquo;Why do we no longer have
miracles?&rdquo; The rationalist&rsquo;s reply, of course, is that, so
soon as nature&rsquo;s laws were better understood, trustworthy
evidence was demanded and miracles ceased. Paley tries to parry the
question by saying: &ldquo;To expect, concerning a miracle, that it
should succeed upon repetition is to expect that which would make it
cease to be a miracle; which is contrary to its nature as such, and
would totally destroy the use and purpose for which it was
wrought.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1957src" href="#xd21e1957"
name="xd21e1957src">2</a> But, as Cotter Morison remarks:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1963src" href="#xd21e1963" name="xd21e1963src">3</a>
&ldquo;Assuming that a miracle reveals the presence of a supernatural
power, why should its repetition destroy its miraculous character?
Above all, why should it destroy its use? If miracles are intended to
convert the stiff-necked and hard-of-heart, what more likely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>way of bringing them to submission than the
repetition of miracles? And, according to Scripture, this was precisely
the way in which Pharaoh, king of Egypt, was humbled. He resisted the
miracles wrought by Moses and Aaron with stubbornness all through the
first nine plagues; but the universal slaying of the first-born broke
even his spirit.... It may suit Paley to say that repetition of
miracles would destroy their use; but he must be a luke-warm theologian
who does not at times wish from the depth of his heart that an
authentic miracle could be produced. Yet it is at this momentous crisis
in the religious affairs of the world, when the enemy is carrying one
position after another, and has all but penetrated to the citadel of
belief, that no miracles occur, that no miracles are claimed, except,
indeed, of the compromising species made at Lourdes.... When no one
doubted the possibility of the frequency of miracles they abounded, we
are told&mdash;that is, when, by reason of their number and the ready
credit accorded to them, their effect was the least startling, then
they were lavished on a believing world. Now, when they are denied and
insulted as the figments of a barbarous age; when the faith they might
support is in such jeopardy as it never was before; when a tithe of the
wonders wasted in the deserts of Sinai and the &lsquo;parts beyond
Jordan&rsquo; would shake the nations with astonishment and
surprise&mdash;when, in short, the least expenditure of miracle would
produce the maximum of result, then miracles mysteriously cease. This
fact, which is beyond contest, has borne fruit, and will yet bear
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some pious Christians, feeling the force of arguments such as these,
contend that Christ&rsquo;s promises <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>to believers do indeed
apply to all time; that supernatural manifestations have not ceased;
and that, when there is no exercise of the supernatural in the visible
Church of Christendom, it is owing to lack of faith. &ldquo;Can you
give me,&rdquo; asks Father Ignatius,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1975src" href="#xd21e1975" name="xd21e1975src">4</a> &ldquo;one
single text in Holy Scripture to prove that miracles and visions are to
cease with the apostles? When we hear, in all directions, of the
supernatural being manifested, we need not wonder, for we are living in
a day which demands supernatural manifestations more than any other
epoch in the Christian Church.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch2.1.3">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">BELIEF IN MIRACLES ESSENTIAL.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The old argument in support of miracles and
inspiration was clearly vitiated by its circular nature, for it was to
the effect that miracles were true because asserted to be so in the
Bible, which was the inspired word of God, and that the Bible was
inspired because the miracles proved it to be so. This argument is
gradually being dropped, and I have only alluded to it to show how much
importance used to be, and, for the matter of that, still is, attached
to miracles, as proving the truth of the Bible. Butler, Paley, Mansel,
Mozley, Farrar, Westcott, Liddon, and a host of other authorities,
could not conceive that revelation could be made in any other way than
by miracles, and felt that without them Christianity would be proved
false and overthrown. Such also appears to be the opinion of the
majority of our living dignitaries. On the other hand, the minority,
which we may take to be represented by the able writers in <i>Contentio
Veritatis</i> and elsewhere, maintain that &ldquo;the time is past when
Christianity could be presented as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>a revelation attested by
miracles.... We must accept Christianity, not on the ground of the
miracles, but in spite of them.... There has been no special
intervention of the Divine Will contrary to the natural order of
things.&rdquo; That is, by ruling miracles to be out of court, the new
school are able to reconcile the facts of science with the Christian
faith. &ldquo;Our belief in Jesus Christ must be based upon moral
conviction; not upon physical wonder.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1988src" href="#xd21e1988" name="xd21e1988src">5</a> The old
school, on the other hand, consider Christianity to be untrue without
miracles. &ldquo;The miraculous element,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;cannot
be weeded out of the Gospel narratives without altogether impugning the
historical value of these documents.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1994src" href="#xd21e1994" name="xd21e1994src">6</a> They are
able to maintain this position, and yet remain believers, by
disallowing the facts of science. It is an extraordinary state of
affairs, and who can wonder that many of the laity who know of these
things are meanwhile fast lapsing into agnosticism? As a matter of
fact, no bishop, no clerk in Holy Orders, can honestly retain his
preferment unless he believes in miracles. He would have to follow the
example of the late Sir Leslie Stephen, and resign.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 2. <i>Miracle Apologetics.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The question arises, &ldquo;How, then, do the majority
of our spiritual guides regard the accounts of miracles in the
Bible?&rdquo; Broadly speaking, miracles are divided by them into three
classes&mdash;(1) mythical, but containing spiritual truths; (2)
explicable naturally; (3) historical and vital. Should their views be
of a very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>advanced type, all the miracles will be relegated
to the first two classes. If advanced, but not quite so much advanced,
the fundamental miracles of the Incarnation, Resurrection, and
Ascension will be taken into the third class; the miracles deemed to be
not indispensable, or not serving a useful purpose, being explained
away. Continuing to descend the scale of enlightenment, more and more
miracles will find their way into the third class, until no miracles
alleged to have been performed by Christ himself will be
discredited&mdash;except, perhaps, those that appear particularly
incredible or useless, such as sending devils into swine, turning water
into wine, or withering a fig tree. Regarding the miracles alleged to
have been performed by the Apostles we hear very little. Concerning the
Old Testament miracles, however, opinions are freely expressed, and
range between those of the Broad Church, who consider the miracles all
belong to the first two classes, and those of the strictly orthodox,
who maintain all the miraculous events to be facts, on the principle
that, whether the whale swallowed Jonah or Jonah swallowed the whale,
they must be true because they are related in the Holy
Scriptures&mdash;the Scriptures that were accepted as historical by
their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. People who are the children of
Christian parents have been brought up from childhood to a literal
acceptance of the miracles, and now they are not only asked to give up
the convictions so sedulously implanted while their minds were most
receptive, but to choose between the conflicting views of the
expounders of God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Let us consider some examples of the latest interpretations, and see
if they appeal to our hearts and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>minds. &ldquo;In <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%205">John v</a>. (the
authenticity of the passage is of no moment to this argument) we read
that the stirring of the waters and the consequent healing virtue was
attributed to the presence of an angel. The modern would speak of the
pool as a medicinal spring. The fact is the same. The mode of
description is different. The ancient knew little of what are called
natural causes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2016src" href=
"#xd21e2016" name="xd21e2016src">7</a> The explanation is sensible
enough; but, while incidentally showing that the Evangelists were just
as credulous and ignorant as other people of their times, it is a
dangerous concession. For directly a natural explanation of this kind
is allowed in one case, it must also be allowed as possible in another,
and thus the fundamental miracles might be shorn of all that renders
them of any value for substantiating our faith. Regarding the
particular explanation under consideration, one may be permitted to
ask, How is it the water has lost its medicinal qualities? Also, How is
it the ancient&rsquo;s belief is still foisted on the credulous modern?
When visiting the traditional Pool of Bethesda, now in the custody of
the Greek Church, I saw documents exposed in the gateway giving the
words from the fifth chapter of St. John in fifty-six different
languages!</p>
<p>The healing miracles performed by Jesus are now frequently
attributed to the use of the same power as that by which faith-cures
are effected at the present time&mdash;a power upon which the science
of psychology is shedding a new light, and which mental therapeutics
will one day place at the disposal of the human race. Apart from this
disappointing alteration in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>character of the &ldquo;mighty
works&rdquo; which were supposed to betoken the divinity of Christ, is
there not something abhorrent in the thought that <i>He should take
advantage of a secret knowledge of the powers of nature, in order to
impose upon the credulity of the age in which He lived, and thus secure
the worship of His disciples</i>? At least, if we are Christians, let
us assume that Christ, as man, <i>believed</i> He was using
supernatural powers, and that His disciples, if they had faith enough,
could remove mountains, just as He undoubtedly <i>believed</i>,
according to such an eminent authority as Dr. Sanday, that He really
was casting out devils when He cured &ldquo;the epileptic,&rdquo; etc.
It is certainly difficult to understand this ignorance of the Son of
God; but, when apologists attempt to extricate Christian dogmas from
the quagmire of doubt by such methods, they only succeed in causing
them to disappear into it beyond all hope of recovery.</p>
<p>As I have alluded to the subject of Christ&rsquo;s belief in
&ldquo;devil-possession,&rdquo; I should mention here that there are
still many cultured ecclesiastics, especially among those who still
believe that there is such a personage as the Devil, who argue that
there was such a malady as devil-possession in those days. Some even
hold that it still exists. On the other hand, the Rev. David Smith, in
his book, <i>The Days of His Flesh</i>, which professes to bring the
Gospels &ldquo;up to date,&rdquo; holds that Jesus, &ldquo;<i>after his
wont</i>, fell in with the delusion,&rdquo; and that in the case in
which the Gadarene swine play so important a part, He, &ldquo;like a
wise physician, humanised the madman&rsquo;s fancy, and feigned
acquiescence in his lunatic craze.&rdquo; Exorcism, it may be remarked,
has been practised, in all times, wherever <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>a belief
has existed in literal demoniacal possession. In the Latin and Greek
Churches it is used in the baptism of both adults and infants, in the
consecration of water, salt, oil, etc., and in specific cases of
individuals supposed to be possessed by evil spirits. Exorcism in
baptism is still retained also in some Lutheran Churches. In Jerusalem,
at the present time, there are three dissenting sects, whose ministers
practise the exorcism of spirits.</p>
<p>Opinions differ widely as to whether certain miracles actually
occurred, or whether they admit of a natural explanation. Take the
miracle of &ldquo;the Feeding of the Five Thousand.&rdquo; The school,
of which the Bishop of Birmingham, late of Worcester, and the learned
Dr. Sanday are the mouthpieces, consider that, &ldquo;whatever may have
actually occurred, a nineteenth-century observer would have given, if
he had been present, a different account from that which has come down
to us.&rdquo; On the other hand, the Bishop of London believes this
miracle to have occurred &ldquo;because of the very humble,
unimaginative [?], and truthful men who reported it.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2047src" href="#xd21e2047" name="xd21e2047src">8</a>
Could any two views be more diametrically opposite?</p>
<p>Obviously, as has already been pointed out, destructive admissions
concerning any one of the miracles tend to invalidate the truth of all
the rest; and, therefore, we find that apologists of a less advanced
stamp are still inclined to the view that the miracles connected with
the life of Christ are miracles pure and simple. Godet, in his
<i>Defence of the Christian Faith</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>explains that &ldquo;It
will become easy to understand why the prodigies which signalised the
advent of Jesus Christ upon earth do not occur in our day.... The
appearance of the perfectly Holy Man was so trenchant a break in the
life of humanity up to that moment that from the shock it produced
there resulted consequences which have not repeated themselves at any
other period.... One condition was requisite&mdash;viz., that there
should exist a Man fit to be associated with the exercise of the
Creative Omnipotence.&rdquo; Many doubters may be prepared to admit the
necessity of miracles as explained by the learned Professor; but they
contend that, up to the present time, there is no instance of a miracle
having been <i>proved</i>, not even the alleged sinlessness of Jesus
Christ, and they ask why, if God graciously furnished proofs to one
generation, He did not, in His infinite wisdom, ordain that these
proofs should be established for all time, beyond all possibility of
cavil?</p>
<p>Passing on to the miracles of the Old Testament, we often find that
those who still maintain that only the first chapters of the Bible are
legendary will adopt a variation of the second class of
interpretation&mdash;they will say that the events were of an ordinary
character, but occurred in answer to prayer. Joshua is for them an
historical character. However, <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jo%2010:12-14">Joshua x.
12&ndash;14</a> must not be taken literally, but allowance should be
made for poetical licence. Joshua, it is explained, never really
committed himself to the extent of commanding the sun and the moon to
stand still, but only &ldquo;besought God that the black clouds of the
storm driving up the pass from the sea might not be allowed to blot out
the sun and bring night prematurely before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>his
victory was complete.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2067src" href=
"#xd21e2067" name="xd21e2067src">9</a> This prayer, be it remembered,
was for the sake of a work of butchery which God was supposed to have
sanctioned! Besides, as the sun is said to have obeyed Joshua, and,
further, it is said that &ldquo;there was no day like that before it or
after it,&rdquo; at least we are to infer that something very unusual
happened at Joshua&rsquo;s request. The explanation we meet with in
what are considered by some to be the &ldquo;best&rdquo; apologetics is
that the language used is purely figurative, just as one might say,
&ldquo;I hope the sun won&rsquo;t set too soon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We
never had such a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similarly there is the north-east wind theory as a possible
explanation of what might have happened, if the &ldquo;crossing of the
Red Sea&rdquo; ever took place, and if Moses be not as mythical as the
rod with which he divided the waters.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unsatisfactory explanation of all is that regarding
the rainbow. It is agreed, there being no other alternative, that
&ldquo;it is not meant that the rainbow appeared for the first time to
Noah [another purely legendary character] after the Flood [although
this is certainly what the Bible leads one to suppose], but that it was
adopted then as a visible sign of God&rsquo;s covenant, as water is
adopted for a somewhat similar covenant in the New
Testament.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2077src" href="#xd21e2077"
name="xd21e2077src">10</a> It is now known for a fact that, if there
are any historical data for the story, the Flood could only have been
local; but let that pass. Has the rainbow-covenant prevented millions
of people perishing since then in many a mighty flood? Looking at
God&rsquo;s promise as a token of His pity for suffering humanity,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>are not deaths occurring every moment, accompanied
by agony so prolonged and supreme that, compared with them, a death by
drowning would be a happy release? If Jews and Christians still really
believe in this story, how is it that the rainbow attracts not the
slightest devout attention? I have never yet heard this beautiful
spectacle alluded to with any particular reverence. The reason is
obvious. We know that the bow consists of all the prismatic colours
produced in the atmosphere by the refraction and reflection of the
sun&rsquo;s light from the rain drops, and no one regards the Bible
story seriously. Yet our divines try to save the credit of the Bible by
interpretations which are obviously &ldquo;catching at straws.&rdquo;
Such methods are as harmful as they are pitiful.</p>
<p>In all these examples the explanations offered to us seem to come to
this&mdash;the phenomena were purely natural from start to finish, only
they occurred opportunely and were afterwards poetically embellished;
or they contain a spiritual meaning. Perhaps the most extraordinary
argument ever brought forward concerning the &ldquo;sun standing
still&rdquo; is that urged by the learned Bishop Westcott in his
<i>Gospel of the Resurrection</i>. He says (pp. 38&ndash;9): &ldquo;It
would be positively immoral for us now to pray that the tides or the
sun should not rise on a particular day; but, as long as the idea of
the physical law which ruled them was unformed or indistinct, the
prayer would have been reasonable, and (may we not suppose?) the
fulfilment also.&rdquo; It is difficult to believe that these can
really be the words of one of the Church&rsquo;s greatest scholars. To
what extent will not bias influence the brain to use its powers
perversely? It is far-fetched arguments of this kind that increase
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>rather than dispel doubt in the normal mind, and
especially when they are brought forward in all seriousness by the very
pillars of the Church. We are sometimes asked to banish our doubts and
&ldquo;craving for intellectualism,&rdquo; as it is called, and
&ldquo;to come to Christ as little children and in Him to find
rest.&rdquo; Certainly it is only by letting our minds sink to the
level of a little child&rsquo;s, or, what is the same thing, to the
level of a primeval man&rsquo;s, that we could bring ourselves to
accept such childish nonsense. A child asks for the moon, but does not
know the physical impossibility of obtaining his desire. His prayer is
therefore reasonable, and (may we not suppose?) the fulfilment also.
This unconscious trifling with the truth&mdash;for in reality it is
nothing else&mdash;reminds me of a passage in Dr. Smith&rsquo;s
orthodox, but somewhat out of date, <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>,
where an attempt is made to reconcile the Mosaic narrative of Creation
with the discoveries of modern science. It runs as follows: &ldquo;The
very act of creation must have been the introducing of laws; but,
<i>when the work was finished, those laws may have suffered some
modification</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2098src" href=
"#xd21e2098" name="xd21e2098src">11</a></p>
<p>We have seen that, while one section of apologists contend that
belief in the miraculous is essential, other advocates of Christianity
try to get rid of all difficulties by suggesting that such words as
&ldquo;miracles&rdquo; and &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; ought not to be
used. In a paper on &ldquo;The Effect of Science upon
Christianity,&rdquo; which he has contributed to the <i>Christian
Commonwealth</i>, the Rev. R. F. Horton, M.A., D.D., affirms that
&ldquo;the word &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo; is ill-chosen,&rdquo; and he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>adds that &ldquo;it is unknown in the New
Testament, and introduces ideas which are alien to those of
Christ.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;miracles,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2109src" href="#xd21e2109" name="xd21e2109src">12</a> he holds,
is equally unfortunate, and represents a notion which is not contained
in the New Testament terms &ldquo;signs&rdquo; and &ldquo;mighty
works.&rdquo; If this be not word-spinning, then what is? Does it
matter whether we call the raising of Lazarus a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo;
or a &ldquo;sign&rdquo;? Is the miraculous feeding of the multitudes
rendered more credible if we call it a natural instead of a
supernatural occurrence? Is not the whole point of the sign lost, too,
if it be no longer supernatural&mdash;if it becomes a sort of juggling
feat? Dr. Horton leaves us in no doubt as to the object of his play
upon words. He aims at disposing of the difficulties connected with
Christian miracles by affirming that everything in nature is
miraculous. He observes: &ldquo;There is no miracle in the New
Testament so amazing as the fact that from protoplasm has developed the
spiritual life of the saint.&rdquo; He is voicing one of the latest
pleas of the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; apologists&mdash;a plea which is
transparently vain and futile. Development from protoplasm, like all
the other wonders of the universe, takes place in accordance with
natural laws more or less perfectly understood; and these things have
no sort of connection with the &ldquo;signs&rdquo; and &ldquo;mighty
works&rdquo; of the New Testament. Miracles are rejected not because
they are amazing, but because they are contradictory to experience and
at variance with the laws of nature. So far the scientist considers the
&ldquo;reign of law&rdquo; to be an established scientific fact, and he
is naturally loth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span>to conclude, without the strongest evidence,
that, after all, he has been deceived. Much less would he come to such
a conclusion when there is not even a particle of trustworthy evidence.
There is the significant circumstance, too, that the laws now
discovered were unknown at the time of the alleged performance of
miracles, and that the belief in miracles, and in the supposed
continuance of miracles, varies in inverse proportion to knowledge.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The above samples of apologetics fairly represent the
various ways in which miracles are now explained. Even if the reasoning
were sound, it would hardly serve to strengthen the arguments for those
miracles which cannot and must not be explained away&mdash;the miracles
on which are based the central doctrines of the Christian Faith.
Christianity stands or falls according as the Resurrection and
Ascension are facts or not. The Rationalist&rsquo;s criticisms have
been presented in many articles and books, but perhaps nowhere more
clearly and forcibly than in the well-known work, <i>Supernatural
Religion</i>; and it is worthy of note that these criticisms have been
further strengthened by the latest &ldquo;Higher Criticism,&rdquo; as
set forth in the articles on the Resurrection and Ascension narratives
in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i>. I have specially referred to
<i>Supernatural Religion</i>, because this book created a considerable
stir in theological circles when it first appeared, some years ago, and
also because its arguments are popularly supposed to have been
completely demolished by Bishop Lightfoot in his <i>Essays on the Work
Called &ldquo;Supernatural Religion</i>.&rdquo; But&mdash;and here is a
good instance of the ease with which the laity can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>be
deceived&mdash;if anyone will take the trouble only to glance at these
two works, he will find, to his astonishment, that the whole of the
overwhelmingly important portion of the book under review, such as the
chapters on miracles, on the Resurrection, on the Incarnation, and on
the Ascension, has received no attention! Besides, there is <i>A Reply
to Dr. Lightfoot&rsquo;s Essays</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2156src"
href="#xd21e2156" name="xd21e2156src">13</a> which completely

<h4 class="main">THE RESURRECTION.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Advanced modern criticism shows that the Resurrection
can no longer be regarded as a historical fact, the evidence being
unreliable. This is the sober opinion of professors of theology formed
on the results of the most careful research, and with no preconceived
opinion as to its scientific impossibility. What have the apologists to
say to this? While the obvious discrepancies and deficiencies in the
accounts of the Resurrection are left practically unexplained, the old
argument from the &ldquo;empty tomb&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2167src" href="#xd21e2167" name="xd21e2167src">14</a> is being
discarded as worthless by the best scholars. Again, the new science of
psychology robs &ldquo;the appearances,&rdquo; supposing that they ever
occurred, of any meaning that could be construed into a proof of the
Resurrection. Only one argument of any account is left, and on this the
apologist chiefly pins his faith, more than on anything else. A certain
contemporary of Christ wrote some letters in which he shows a firm
belief in the Resurrection: his name was Paul. The evidence of this one
man is considered sufficient to substantiate a miracle, which is
contrary to all human experience, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>and upon the truth of which
depend the Christian Faith and our hope of immortality! Moreover, St.
Paul was not present himself on any of the occasions of the alleged
appearances; and, except with regard to his own particular
&ldquo;religious experience,&rdquo; his evidence is therefore hearsay.
The statement that Jesus was seen by 500 brethren at once is of little
value, and St. Paul omits to mention what steps he took to ascertain
the accuracy of his information&mdash;who the individuals were, what
the various impressions made upon them were, etc. The appearance to 500
brethren is not mentioned in any of the Gospels. That St. Paul heard
such a report does not prove that the report was true, or, if true,
that the 500 had clear and unmistakable evidence of Christ&rsquo;s
presence.</p>
<p>There are critics who could not accept the evidence of St. Paul, for
the simple reason that they conclude that we possess no Epistles of St.
Paul; that the writings which bear his name are pseudepigrapha,
containing seemingly historical data from the life and labours of the
Apostle borrowed from <i>Acts of Paul</i>&mdash;a work containing, so
far as is known to us, both truth and fiction.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2183src" href="#xd21e2183" name="xd21e2183src">15</a> Less
advanced criticism lays down the broad thesis that all the Pauline
epistles are real letters written by him, but that &ldquo;Paul, who
reckoned the future of this present world not by millennia or
centuries, but by a few short years, had not the faintest surmise of
the part his letters were destined to play in the providential ordering
of the world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2189src" href=
"#xd21e2189" name="xd21e2189src">16</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>Accepting the genuineness of the Epistles, and therefore of the
passage in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:3-8">1 Cor.
xv. 3&ndash;8</a>, let us pause and think over the chief features of
the argument. In the first place, it seems to me that the fact of St.
Paul having been a contemporary of the Messiah really only adds to our
perplexities. When there were so many who were eye-witnesses of His
life, why should God single out one who was not thus favoured as His
chief witness for all posterity? He was living at the same time and in
the same country as Christ, and yet never knew Him. Surely it stands to
reason that an eye-witness is of more value than a mere visionary who
wrote letters revealing a remarkable ignorance of the greater part of
the narrative of the Gospels, and indeed of the whole body of teachings
there ascribed to Jesus. That St. Paul would believe in the
Resurrection before he took up the Christian cause goes without saying;
but that he believed everything he heard from the followers of Christ,
and everything he thought he heard when in a trance, does not, I fear,
amount to much in the way of evidence&mdash;and especially so when we
know that this was an age when the resurrection of any great prophet
was taken to be a normal event. How often, I wonder, in the
world&rsquo;s history have not the disciples of great teachers
attributed miraculous powers to their beloved master, even when with
them alive, and still further magnified these powers after his death?
How often has it not occurred that these same stories have been further
exaggerated in the course of their transmission to succeeding
generations? Nothing is more conceivable than that the Bible story may
spuriously embellish the real life of Jesus as much as the mythical
accounts of Buddha, for instance, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59"
href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>spuriously embellish the real
life of Prince Sidd&acirc;rtha. Of all old-world legends, the death and
resurrection of a virgin-born or in some way divinely-born Saviour was
the most widespread. Saul, the Pharisee, would have been imbued with
this prevalent notion, and so could never get away from the thought
that some kind of propitiation had to be made for the sins of men. Time
after time a terrible suspicion must have crossed his mind&mdash;what
if he were committing a heinous crime in persecuting the Christians?
What if, after all, the Crucified One were the real Saviour of mankind?
Doubts such as these may well have deeply agitated him. The living
figure so often described to him by the Christians must have stood out
before him. On his own testimony, as well as that of the <i>Acts</i>,
he was prone to visions and other ecstatic conditions (<a class=

23</a>). What more natural than that after his &ldquo;religious
experience&rdquo; near Damascus he should be convinced that he had been
specially favoured by an interview with the Saviour?</p>
<p>So many &ldquo;spiritual experiences&rdquo; of a like nature are on
record that it is difficult to know which is the best to select for
comparison. Professor Huxley, in his essay on &ldquo;The Value of
Witness to the Miraculous,&rdquo; takes the cases of Eginhard (born
about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 770), who wrote <i>The History of
the Translation of the Blessed Martyrs of Christ, S.S. Marcellinus and
Petrus</i>; and George Fox, who, about the year 1647, heard voices and
saw visions which assured him that &ldquo;there is a living God who
made all things.&rdquo; Perhaps the case of Emanuel Swedenborg<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2233src" href="#xd21e2233" name=
"xd21e2233src">17</a> may be worth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60"
href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>a moment&rsquo;s consideration.
He was the son of a bishop, and was carefully educated. Endowed with
unusual intellectual powers and an iron constitution, he acquired vast
stores of learning. From early childhood he evinced a serious turn of
mind, combined with a remarkable tendency to indulge in religious
speculations. Eventually he received an extraordinary
&ldquo;call&rdquo; in the shape of a vision. This converted the
scientific inquirer into a supernatural prophet. He was now the
mouthpiece of God. &ldquo;The Lord Himself hath called me, who was
graciously pleased to manifest Himself to me, His unworthy servant, in
a personal experience in the year 1745.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have
never,&rdquo; he says in his work on <i>True Christian Religion</i>,
&ldquo;received anything appertaining to the doctrines of that Church
from any angel, but from the Lord alone, while I was reading the
Word.&rdquo; Swedenborg was a man who won the respect, confidence, and
love of all who came in contact with him. He had a peculiarly abstract
metaphysical character of mind, and was firmly convinced that he had
&ldquo;conversed with spirits&rdquo; and &ldquo;seen the Lord.&rdquo;
So was Martin Luther perfectly convinced that he had seen the Devil
when he threw his ink-pot at him. So was the peasant girl of Lourdes
convinced that she had seen the Virgin Mary. So is Evan Roberts
convinced that he has seen his Saviour. So have many good Christians
from time to time been convinced that they have seen Christ, the Virgin
Mary, saints, and angels. Father Ignatius, the Evangelist monk, may be,
as I have heard him called, an emotional wreck; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>but he
is also a most earnest Christian, and he is quite sure that he has seen
the Virgin Mary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2246src" href="#xd21e2246"
name="xd21e2246src">18</a> John Wesley, whose followers throughout the
world to-day number 30,000,000, was also a visionary. Thousands and
thousands of heathens as well as Christians have had visions of their
saviours; but such experiences could scarcely be brought forward
seriously as a proof of the existence of the divinities believed to
have been seen, or of their ascension after a life upon earth. Visual
and auditory hallucinations are now the subject of a searching inquiry
by the Society for Psychical Research, and, willing as some of its
members are to explain metapsychical phenomena by the simple theory of
the spiritists, the growing opinion is that these apparitions and
voices are purely hallucinatory and due to causes which are not
extra-human.</p>
<p>As Mr. Lowes Dickinson pertinently remarks when speaking of
&ldquo;Conversions&rdquo; in his article on Revelations, in the
<i>Independent Review</i>: &ldquo;The important question is whether the
belief of the recipient in the evidential value of the experience is
justified; and I think that a little consideration will show that it is
not so, for it is noticeable that the truth supposed to be revealed in
the moment of conversion is commonly, if not invariably, the
<i>reflection of the doctrine or theory with which the subject, whether
or no he has accepted it, has hitherto been most familiar. I have never
heard, for example, of a case in which a Mohammedan or a Hindoo,
without having ever heard of Christianity, has had a revelation of
Christian truth</i>. Conversion, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>fact, it would seem, is not the
communication of a <i>new</i> truth; it is the presentation of ideas
already familiar in such a way that they are accompanied by an
irresistible certainty that they are true.... A religious revelation
cannot be distinguished from what would be admitted to be the
hallucinations of disease. A man may be convinced, with equal
assurance, that he is a poached egg or a saint; that he has a mission
to assassinate the king or redeem the world; that he is eternally
damned or eternally saved; that he has had a vision of the Virgin Mary
or a vision of Nirvana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another argument for considering the Resurrection as an historical
fact is that brought forward by the Rev. D. S. Margoliouth. The learned
Professor argues in the <i>Expositor</i> that the Gospel narrative is
located within historic times. So are the narratives of King Arthur
(the Celtic Messiah), or William Tell, or Robin Hood; but historians
are silent about all these narratives, sacred and profane alike. There
was probably a real Arthur, however different from the hero of the
trouv&egrave;res, and a real Robin Hood, however now enlarged and
disguised by the accretion of legend. Similarly there was a real Jesus
Christ; but the marvellous event of His resurrection is <i>unrecorded
by any of the celebrated historians of the period</i>.</p>
<p>The final argument is that &ldquo;the Resurrection is, so to speak,
of a piece with the whole character and the claims of Christ.... Even
had we no Testament at all, we should be obliged to postulate something
very much like either the Resurrection or the belief in the
Resurrection in order to account for Christianity.&rdquo; No one
disputes, I should think, this necessity for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>Resurrection, if we are to remain Christians; but
it is of the fact of the Resurrection that unfortunate doubters wish to
be assured. The Bishop of Ripon argues that the miraculous accessories
connected with the birth and resurrection of Jesus Christ find a place
only in the group of <i>secondary</i> witnesses, and adds
significantly: &ldquo;Our belief in Jesus Christ must be based upon
moral conviction, not upon physical wonder.&rdquo; The meaning of this,
in plain English, is clear enough, and I leave it for the honest-minded
reader to decide whether this is a satisfactory foundation for the
Christian dogmas. Is this what he was taught, or what his children are
now being taught? Will it suffice? Can he remain a Christian? Will his
children, when they grow up and begin to think for themselves, remain
Christians? The Dean of Westminster writes to the Archbishop of
Canterbury: &ldquo;Students of natural science find themselves left
with St. Luke as the strongest historical evidence within the New
Testament.&rdquo; Now, the author of St. Luke is also the author of the
<i>Acts</i>, and his propensity for miraculous decoration is by no
means reassuring. Besides, he was not an eye-witness. Then, too, we
have Canon Henson, in the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> for April, 1904,
informing us that &ldquo;Any candid Christian reading through the
accounts of the New Testament evidences ... cannot escape the inference
that the evidence for the quasi-historical statements of the Creed is
of a highly complicated, dubious, and even contradictory
character.&rdquo; He then asks us: &ldquo;Is an honest belief in the
Resurrection really inconsistent with a reverent agnosticism as to the
historical circumstances out of which in the first instance that belief
arose?&rdquo; The reply of an ordinary <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>candid layman is, I
think, sufficiently obvious. Similarly, Abb&eacute; Loisy, the champion
of advanced theology in the Roman Catholic Church, considers the
Resurrection to be a spiritual fact only, and not a fact of the
historical order. &ldquo;<span lang="fr">La R&eacute;surrection
n&rsquo;est pas proprement un fait d&rsquo;ordre
historique.</span>&rdquo; The powerful article in the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i> also leads us to the same
conclusion.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the fact of the Resurrection, and have not
Canon Henson&rsquo;s reverent agnosticism concerning the event, must
believe also in all the facts related in connection with it, including
the account of Jesus having eaten and having been touched, and of his
bodily ascent up into the clouds. If any one portion of the story be
considered incredible or untrustworthy, the whole collapses. It may be
useful, therefore, to put to ourselves some questions concerning any
one of the many marvellous accessories of the Resurrection. How few of
us have ever had our belief tested by searching questions such as a
cultured heathen would put if we tried to convert him? For instance,
what would you reply if you were asked by an intelligent native of
India, China, or Japan: &ldquo;Who were the saints of whom Matthew
speaks as having risen from their graves? To whom did they appear? And
how was it that their graves were opened as Jesus died, while their
bodies did not come out till after His Resurrection? What also became
of them afterwards?&rdquo; To this the only candid reply possible would
be: &ldquo;I am unable to give you any information on this subject.
Their not appearing till after Jesus rose from death would seem to have
been introduced so as not to give them the precedence over Him in the
exercise of the privilege of resurrection. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>He is
said to be &lsquo;the first that should rise from the dead&rsquo;

18</a>).&rdquo; This, however, would hardly satisfy your questioner,
who would reply: &ldquo;Your inability to give me this information
excites my suspicions, and your further statements seem to me to be
very clumsy. To mark and enhance the death of the Messiah, nature is
said to be convulsed, and graves thrown open; but the exit of the
saints who were to come out of them is restrained till He should first
have made His egress from the tomb three days later. And, after all, He
had no such precedence in resurrection, for several persons are said to
have been raised from the dead by the prophets of old and by Himself;
two passed into heaven without ever being in their graves, and one of
them&mdash;namely, Elias&mdash;appeared to Him with Moses in risen life
at the time of His transfiguration. May I ask, Are the disturbances of
nature which are said to have occurred at the crucifixion&mdash;namely,
the preternatural darkness for three hours and the
earthquake&mdash;mentioned by historians of the time?&rdquo; You would
have to confess, &ldquo;They are not.&rdquo; Thus you would fail to
convert your heathen interlocutor, whose final fling at you would be:
&ldquo;That seems to demonstrate that nothing of the kind could really
have occurred. Moreover, had there been such phenomena, the other
evangelists would not have failed to support their position with these
divine manifestations.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="main">THE ASCENSION.</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If apologetics dealing with the Resurrection are
unconvincing, still more so are those regarding the Ascension. There is
little or no attempt to explain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>the meagreness of the Gospel
narratives, how all mention of it is omitted in the Gospels of St.
Matthew and St. John; and one vague sentence is all we are given in St.
Mark and St. Luke&mdash;sentences which, according to the Higher
Critics, were never penned by these persons. In &ldquo;The Acts&rdquo;
the &ldquo;St. Luke&rdquo; writer furnishes the detail that &ldquo;a
cloud received him out of their sight,&rdquo; and that, &ldquo;as He
went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, which also
said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same
Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.&rdquo; In these days
&ldquo;ascending up&rdquo; has no meaning for us. Candidly, if the
writer had had our astronomical knowledge, would these words ever have
been written? Certainly they would not. Then is the Ascension a fact or
is it not? How is it possible that St. Matthew and St. John could have
remained silent regarding such an event if they had really witnessed
it? Or granting, in the case of the writer of &ldquo;St. John,&rdquo;
that he was not St. John the Apostle, though he distinctly says he was,
it is still astounding that he should have omitted to record such
important evidence of Christ&rsquo;s divinity, if it was an accepted
fact at the time he wrote.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Wilson, in a paper read at the Diocesan Conference at
Manchester, October 22nd, 1903, asks: &ldquo;What do we mean in our
Creed when we say: &lsquo;He came down from heaven&rsquo;? We explain
away &lsquo;down,&rsquo; we explain away &lsquo;heaven&rsquo; in the
sense in which the word was originally used. What do we mean by
&lsquo;descended into Hell&rsquo;? by &lsquo;Sitteth on the right hand
of God&rsquo;?... Spiritual truths are spiritually discerned,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>and do not admit of final intellectual
definitions. We can only avert the rejection of theology by recognising
its limitations.&rdquo; Is it possible for the bulk of humanity, I ask,
to possess the requisite spiritual discernment? Is it not far more
likely that, with the spread of education, they will finally reject
theology?</p>
<p>The Rev. David Smith, in his book, <i>The Days of His
Flesh</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2321src" href="#xd21e2321" name=
"xd21e2321src">19</a> dismisses the Ascension with the words:
&ldquo;When Jesus parted from the eleven on Olivet, He did not forsake
the earth and migrate to a distant Heaven. He ceased to manifest
Himself; but He is here at this hour no otherwise than during those
forty days.&rdquo; One can but wonder how Ascension Day is kept in Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s church, and how he brings himself to repeat the
Apostles&rsquo; Creed.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the thoroughly unreliable nature of the Bible accounts
of the Ascension, consider how easy it is for the superstitious,
through optical illusions or subjective visions (or whatever name it
may please the neologist to give to these &ldquo;experiences&rdquo;),
to be honestly convinced of the occurrence of a supernatural event, and
to take care that it should lose nothing of its marvellous character in
the telling. Only the other day the good people of Sudja saw a mighty
iris-coloured cross appear over the cathedral during divine service,
and regarded the phenomenon as a sign of heaven&rsquo;s resolve to
bestow victory upon Christian Russia. This &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; was
witnessed by all the notabilities of the city, who forwarded a
description to General Kuropatkin in a document duly attested with
their signatures. For the stupendous and absurdly impossible miracle of
the Ascension we have not even got a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>satisfactory description,
much less an attested document. Is it not time that we should ask
ourselves the plain question, Do we really believe that an
extraordinary levitation occurred, and that Jesus Christ was seen to be
rising in the air until some passing clouds concealed Him from view? If
we do not so believe, why do we say we do when we repeat the Creed? Why
do we pretend we do when we sit in church and listen to the account of
the Ascension, and perhaps to a sermon on it? Why do we allow our
friends to think that we do so believe? Why is Ascension Day one of our
Holy Days? And, finally, why do we teach, or allow others to teach, our
children what we know to be untrue? Surely these are serious questions
to ask ourselves.</p>

<h4 class="main">THE INCARNATION.</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There remains the miracle of the Virgin-birth. That
this is under dispute among Christian theologians is notorious, and the
controversy has but served to show with ever-increasing clearness how
untrustworthy is the evidence for this miracle. Christian Biblical
experts inform us that it belongs to the latest strata of the New
Testament tradition, and that no trace of the story can be found before
120 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> In other words, that it is an obvious
interpolation in St. Matthew and St. Luke. Adolf Harnack, the learned
Professor of Church History in the University of Berlin, is looked
upon, even by the orthodox, as one of our greatest living Biblical
scholars, and we learn from him that we must disregard the history of
Jesus&rsquo; birth given in these two Gospels; for not only is it
untrustworthy, but &ldquo;the evangelists themselves never refer to it,
nor make Jesus Himself refer to His antecedents. On the contrary, they
tell us that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>Jesus&rsquo; mother and His brethren were
completely surprised at His coming forward, and did not know what to
make of it. Paul, too, is silent; so that we can be sure that the
oldest tradition knew nothing of any stories of Jesus&rsquo;
birth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2338src" href="#xd21e2338"
name="xd21e2338src">20</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Moral fitness&rdquo; appears to be the only argument that we
can fall back upon, and this is now the apologists&rsquo; last
stronghold. If they belong to the Church of England, they should
remember that it was this identical line of reasoning that gave rise to
the &ldquo;pious opinion&rdquo; that the Mother of Christ had herself
been miraculously preserved from all taint of original sin from the
first moment of her conception in the womb of her mother. As Bernard of
Clairvaux vigorously argued (in 1140 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>):
&ldquo;On the same principle you would be obliged to hold that the
conception of her ancestors, in an ascending line, was also a holy one,
since otherwise she would not have descended from them worthily.&rdquo;
Yet, in spite of the absurdity, the doctrine of the Immaculate
Conception was formally defined, as a dogma binding on the acceptance
of all the faithful, by the bull <i lang="la">Ineffabilis Deus</i>
(December 8th, 1854). Certainly there is a moral fitness in the
Virgin-birth of the Son of God, and it is also fit that His mother
should have been immaculately conceived; and those who hold to the one
doctrine may well hold to the other.</p>
<p>Some apologists appear almost in despair of a continuance of belief
in this dogma. The learned Dr. Sanday says we ought to regard the
Virgin-birth &ldquo;as one of those hidden mysteries which, whether or
not God wills that we should believe them now, He has, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>at all
events, willed that men should believe in times past.&rdquo; Is not
this tantamount to giving up belief in the Virgin-birth?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch2.3.4">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Because God once willed that men should have all kinds
of absurd superstitions, and now wills that they should acknowledge
their absurdity, are we, as Dr. Sanday appears to recommend, to keep up
the pretence of believing in them on the ground that they are hidden
mysteries? Surely not; but, speaking of mysteries, there is one which
ought to be cleared, or at least receive a much fuller investigation
than it has yet received at the hands of the Church. I refer to the
fact that, ages before the Christian era, certain miracles were
believed to have taken place, and that these were of <i>precisely the
same nature as those recorded in the Bible</i>. For instance, numerous
saviours were believed to have been born of virgins, to have died for
the sins of mankind, to have risen again from the dead, and to have
ascended into heaven. Thus not only are the Bible miracles
scientifically impossible; not only are they unsupported by anything
approaching adequate evidence; not only do the specious explanations of
apologists serve but to confirm our scepticism concerning them; but we
find that they are not even original&mdash;that they form part of
ancient superstitions. That these fresh grounds for suspecting the
truth of Christianity are of the gravest character will be shown in the
chapter on Comparative Mythology. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"

<h3 class="main">&sect; 1. <i>Clashing Views on Bible
Criticism.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Such, then, is an outline of the state of apologetics
on the subject of Miracles in general, and of those connected with the
central doctrines of the Church in particular. Nothing could be more
unsatisfactory, nothing more calculated to arouse suspicion of the
Faith; and now, if we turn our attention to the &ldquo;Higher
Criticism,&rdquo; and to the apologetics it has called forth, we shall
find these suspicions still further strengthened. On the one hand a
considerable proportion of these criticisms are accepted by the more
enlightened divines, and, on the other hand, those who refuse to accept
any of them urge that they undermine Christianity.</p>
<p>The Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Wace, is one of the latter class.
Speaking at a men&rsquo;s service (at St. Mary Bredin&rsquo;s Church,
Canterbury, on December 4th, 1904), he justly twits the critics for
describing a considerable part of the Bible, and particularly the early
part, as &ldquo;not historical,&rdquo; when &ldquo;what they mean is
that it is not true.&rdquo; No subtle theories are required to support
Dr. Wace&rsquo;s belief in Christianity, for even the first chapter of
Genesis is, in his opinion, a &ldquo;substantially accurate&rdquo;
account of &ldquo;that which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>happened on earth before there were
any men upon it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;is the best proof that the Bible
proceeded from God.&rdquo; He remains among the dwindling number of
those who, in these days of Christian storm and stress, still cling to
the old ideas about the Bible. His reasons for doing so are apparently
similar to those given by &ldquo;Roger&rdquo; in a little pamphlet
entitled <i>Roger&rsquo;s Reasons</i> (by John Urquhart), where it is
sought to reconcile the Bible and Science at the expense of accuracy,
logic, and common sense. For the obscurantist, belief is made easy, and
the apologies for the Faith can be comparatively straightforward. For
the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; the conditions are reversed.</p>
<p>An example of the advanced views of a Church of England divine, and
of the objections to these views of a strictly orthodox Churchman, may
prove instructive. Reviewing the Bishop of Winchester&rsquo;s book,
<i>On Holy Scripture and Criticism</i>, the <i>Church Times</i> (of
February 10th, 1905) pertinently observes: &ldquo;Attacks upon the
Gospel narratives of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection, made with
such persistence from within the Church, are ugly developments which
were not anticipated in 1890. Yet, strange to say, there is no
recognition of the new situation in the Bishop of Winchester&rsquo;s
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This silence regarding points especially requiring explanation is, I
fear, a common feature in religious apologetics. Look again at the
reviewer&rsquo;s next remark: &ldquo;The Bishop forgets that the truth
of the message is intimately connected with the authenticity of the
record, and a critical theory which assails the one assails the
other.&rdquo; Here, then, we have an elementary truth frankly
recognised; and, in plain English, it means that, if the Bishop&rsquo;s
criticisms be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>true, Christianity is untrue. Entering into more
detail, the writer goes on to say: &ldquo;For example, the Bible record
of the Fall and the truth of our Lord&rsquo;s &lsquo;atoning death on
the Cross&rsquo; are closely connected with each other. Modern
criticism discards the former as a myth, and indications abound on
every side that the denial of the Fall leads to a denial of the
Atonement. It is not too much to say that the new method of
interpreting the Bible has helped to overthrow belief in Christ as a
Divine Redeemer. His redemptive work and mediatorial office have been
thrust into the background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The situation could not be put more lucidly. There is no
hair-splitting or glozing here. The reviewer characterises this silence
on crucial points as &ldquo;grave omissions,&rdquo; and he might have
added that such omissions are calculated to arouse suspicions of the
Faith. He continues: &ldquo;Again the Bishop says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Think of the use made of the Hebrew Scriptures by the
Apostles in the Acts, or by St. Paul in his Epistles. It is ever the
spiritual and moral lesson.</p>
</div>
<p>It is by no means &lsquo;ever&rsquo; the spiritual and moral lesson
only. Both in the Book of the Acts and St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles the
historical and predictive portions of the Jewish Scriptures are
constantly appealed to, and used as the basis of argument. The
suggestion that the Apostles attached little importance to the latter
is far from being borne out by the evidence. One of the chief things in
which they differ from writers of the modern school is their use of Old
Testament history and prediction. Compare the place which prophecy
occupies in the Epistle to the Romans with the place it holds in the
Bishop of Winchester&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>book, where no more than sixteen
lines in 187 pages are allotted to it.<a id="xd21e2410" name=
"xd21e2410"></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of the Synoptic Gospels describes the scene at the
Transfiguration, when Moses and Elias talked with our Lord in the sight
of three of His disciples. St. Luke mentions that they talked about His
approaching death. In the face of that narrative, those who say that
our Lord knew no more of Moses than any Jew of the period are bound to
explain how they reconcile the statement with the Evangelists&rsquo;
account of the Transfiguration. No Jewish scribe of the first century
a.d. could pretend to have seen or conversed with either Elijah or
Moses. Bishop Ryle says of our Lord:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">In His incidental references to Moses, He adopts the
language of the Scribes.... He never displayed knowledge of facts which
could not be possessed by those of his own time.... To His intellectual
powers in His humanity there seem to have been assigned the natural
barriers of the time in which he lived.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop does not perceive apparently that these arguments
cut both ways, so that they tell against our Lord&rsquo;s claim to
foreknow the future quite as much as against His knowledge of the past.
And we are entitled to ask how they can possibly be made to agree with
the express testimony of the Evangelists that Moses and Elijah were
seen in Christ&rsquo;s company, and &lsquo;spake of the decease which
He should accomplish at Jerusalem.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have quoted these apposite remarks at length because they will
come with more force from the mouth of an orthodox believer than from
anyone in doubt like myself. One cannot help wondering what the Bishop
could have to urge in reply; for the ground is cut from under him by
his own acceptance of so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>much of modern criticism. As he is a
high dignitary of the Church, it is all the more puzzling. Referring to
the remarks concerning Moses, it may be mentioned that, according to
the critics, Moses is not a historical personage.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2424src" href="#xd21e2424" name="xd21e2424src">1</a> Whether the
Bishop accepts this or not it is difficult to say; but apparently he
does, from his desire to explain that, &ldquo;in His references to
Moses,&rdquo; Christ &ldquo;adopts the language of the
Scribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Driver&rsquo;s new book on <i>Genesis</i> has also called forth
some adverse criticisms from the less advanced. For example, Dr. Lock,
the Warden of Keble, enumerates several considerations in support of
the general trustworthiness of the patriarchal narratives, and observes
that the fact of inspiration, once admitted on the higher level of a
moral and spiritual tone, may &ldquo;well carry its influence over into
details of fact, and turn the balance when otherwise uncertain.&rdquo;
Personally, I very much doubt whether the general public, once informed
of the truth, will ever be induced to look at facts through Dr.
Lock&rsquo;s spiritual spectacles. Dr. Driver, it should be added,
informs us that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph were presumably
monotheists, though their monotheism is rudimentary, and the terms in
which they express themselves &ldquo;suggest much riper spiritual
capacities and experiences,&rdquo; being, &ldquo;in some cases,
<i>borrowed evidently from the phraseology of a much later
age</i>.&rdquo; Can we depend upon such narrators to furnish us with
true history? Commenting on Dr. Driver&rsquo;s &ldquo;impossible
interpretations&rdquo; of the words, &ldquo;it shall bruise thy
head,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;the story of the Fall,&rdquo; his reviewer
in the <i>Church Times</i> asks: &ldquo;Was it, or was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>it not,
a promise made by God? This is the plain question which Dr.
Driver&rsquo;s readers are forced to ask.&rdquo; Sceptical
truthseekers, also, are asking the same question. When will they
receive a &ldquo;straight&rdquo; answer?</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 2. <i>A Summary of the Results of Bible
Criticism.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The general public know little or nothing of the
results of Bible criticism. Why should they? Not only do they deem it a
dull subject, but those who attend church are being informed from the
pulpit that &ldquo;the Gospels have been battered by years of
criticism, but have come out of it stronger than ever.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2450src" href="#xd21e2450" name="xd21e2450src">2</a>
It is easy enough to make statements of this kind, and, doubtless, they
serve temporarily to quiet the fears of a congregation who know very
little of the subject, and are only too glad to believe what they are
told so authoritatively; but, unfortunately, such statements are, to
put it mildly, misleading. The ordinary man is wofully ignorant of the
&ldquo;Higher Criticism.&rdquo; His ideas of Bible difficulties are
mostly confined to common sense. He knows, perhaps, that scoffers of
the London parks freethinking type gibe at Holy Writ, and he may
himself have made fun of some passages that appear absurd; but here his
knowledge of Bible criticism ceases. He is not aware that the critics
are a body of the most erudite experts in theology, whose only motive
for offering their opinion is to give to the world the result of their
arduous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>research&mdash;the motives, in fact, of a Bruno, a
Darwin, or a Pasteur.</p>
<p>In view of this widespread ignorance, I propose to enumerate briefly
a few of the results of modern criticism, and, in giving these results,
I shall omit those arising from a study of comparative mythology and of
evolution, as I have devoted separate chapters to that purpose.</p>
<p>A work has been issued lately which sums up the conclusions of Bible
criticism&mdash;higher,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2462src" href=
"#xd21e2462" name="xd21e2462src">3</a> lower or textual, and
historical. It is called the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i>. Its
four massive volumes set forth the new views, and support them by a
mass of learning which deserves our serious consideration.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2471src" href="#xd21e2471" name="xd21e2471src">4</a>
Space permits of my giving only a few notes of its conclusions, and but
meagre details of the wealth of evidence in support of them.</p>
<p><i>The Creation Story a Myth.</i>&mdash;The story of the Creation as
given in Genesis originated in a stock of primitive myths common to the
Semitic races. Its coincidences with the Babylonian myth are so
numerous that it is impossible to doubt the existence of a real
historical connection between them. Many indications show that not till
after the Exile in the sixth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> did
the story take its present shape.</p>
<p><i>The Patriarchs Unhistorical Figures.</i>&mdash;Then, again, all
the stories of the Patriarchs are legendary; they may contain some
truth, though how much will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>probably never be known; to suppose
them entirely true is to throw historical criticism altogether
overboard. Dr. Peters is the Episcopal rector of a large parish in New
York, who has done good service in the past, both as Professor of
Biblical Literature in the Episcopal Seminary at Philadelphia and as
the first leader of the expedition to Babylonia sent out in 1888 by the
University of Pennsylvania. He has lately written a book called <i>The
Early Hebrew Story: Its Historical Background</i>. Canon Cheyne,
reviewing this book in the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> for January, 1905,
remarks: &ldquo;It will be granted that Dr. Peters&rsquo;s view of the
origination of the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and, to some
extent, of Joseph, in myths, legends, and traditions of sanctuaries, is
a sound one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Book of Genesis Legendary.</i>&mdash;The book of Genesis is a
composite narrative based on older records long since lost. It appears
to have been compiled in the seventh century <span class=
"sc">b.c.</span>, and to have been added to again later. The story of
the Deluge is a Hebrew version of the Babylonian epic.</p>
<p><i>Book of Exodus Legendary.</i>&mdash;The book of Exodus, too, is
another composite legend which has long been mistaken for history.
Sober history gives no warrant for supposing that the signs and wonders
wrought by Moses ever occurred, that the first-born of Egypt were ever
slain, or that Pharaoh was ever drowned in the Red Sea.</p>
<p><i>Moses a Legendary Character.</i>&mdash;The historical character
of Moses has not been established, and it is doubtful whether the name
is that of an individual or that of a clan. The alleged origin of the
Ten Commandments is purely legendary; it is probable that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>they
were framed not earlier than the time of Amos. It is admitted even by
conservative critics that the original worship of the Israelites was
not of an ethical character.</p>
<p>One of the first suspicions that ever crossed my mind was with
regard to the sudden and complete disappearance of the &ldquo;two
tables of testimony, tables of stone written with the finger of
God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2512src" href="#xd21e2512" name=
"xd21e2512src">5</a> Later on, when I knew of the Moabite
stone<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2523src" href="#xd21e2523" name=
"xd21e2523src">6</a> and the Rosetta stone,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2529src" href="#xd21e2529" name="xd21e2529src">7</a> and
especially when I learnt that there were inscriptions on bricks and
cylinders of a far earlier date than that ascribed to the giving of the
Ten Commandments, the old perplexity returned with added force. I
remember, too, the same feeling of dissatisfaction and suspicion as I
gazed on the clearly-cut Pali inscriptions in the Buddhist caves near
Poona, and thought of those lost tables said to have been inscribed by
the finger of God. I once put the question to a well-read clerical
friend of mine: &ldquo;How can these tables, written by the finger of
God or by His direct inspiration, have been lost? How is it that they
have simply disappeared without a word of explanatory comment in the
Bible? It is inconceivably strange. What a witness would they not have
been to the truth of the Old Testament account, and to the Divine
authority for the Commandments!&rdquo; His reply was: &ldquo;It would
never have done for these stones to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>been preserved, for they
would have become objects of worship.&rdquo; Granted that they might
have become objects of adoration, which is worse&mdash;to worship faked
relics such as the water in which Joseph of Arimathea washed the
blood-stained body of Jesus, portions of wood from the true Cross, bits
from the crown of thorns, and thousands of odd pieces of bone from the
anatomy of the Saints; or to venerate stones that would at least have
had the merit of being genuine? Why are we left without any reliable
evidences of God&rsquo;s miraculous revelation of Himself to men, while
we have abundant evidence for occurrences of trifling importance to
mankind that happened thousands of years before the alleged revelation?
Hammurabi (a Babylonian monarch who flourished two thousand years or
more before the Christian era) inscribed a very excellent, if somewhat
drastic, code of laws upon a pillar of black diorite, and we have now
got the stone and read the inscriptions; but the stone inscribed <i>by
God</i> is lost!</p>
<p><i>The Book of Deuteronomy.</i>&mdash;Evidence of every kind concurs
to prove that in its original form it was a product of the seventh, not
of the fifteenth, century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> In its present
form, Deuteronomy is a composite and considerably modified version of
the older work. Originally it may have consisted merely of the long
speech attributed to Moses, and this may have been the book which was
&ldquo;found&rdquo; in the temple in the reign of Josiah, the rest of
the work being added shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>As it is difficult to believe that such a work would have remained
in the temple undiscovered for eight hundred years, is it not
reasonable to conclude that the book was placed there by men who
thought the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>time ripe for religious reforms&mdash;in fact,
that a &ldquo;pious fraud&rdquo; was perpetrated?</p>
<p><i>The Psalms a Composite Book.</i>&mdash;The fond delusion that all
the Psalms were written by David (though why we should be anxious to
ascribe what is really of much ethical value to a person confessedly
immoral I never could understand) has been entirely dispelled. It is
doubtful whether David wrote any of the Psalms.</p>
<p><i>Poetry and Prophetic Literature.</i>&mdash;The book of Job is not
a literary unity, nor was it written with any particular purpose; it is
not a manufacture, but a growth.</p>
<p>Jonah is a Jewish <i>midrash</i>, or tradition, like the histories
of Tobit and Susanna, and was certainly written after the Exile. Even
orthodox clergymen now admit (in private) that the Jonah story is a
fairy tale.</p>
<p>The great book of Isaiah is the work of several authors.</p>
<p>The book of Daniel was once assumed to be the most definitely
prophetical of the Old Testament writings&mdash;a notion which is
seriously discounted by the discovery that it was beyond question
written in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, <i>after</i> or
<i>during</i> the happening of the events which were supposed to be
foretold, and nearly 500 years after the time of its supposed author.
It is questionable whether such a person as Daniel ever existed; but it
is certain that his adventure in the den of lions, and that of
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the fiery furnace, are as fabulous
as any in the collection of &AElig;sop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo; says Canon Cheyne, &ldquo;the prophets
directly connect the final restoration with the removal of the sins of
their own age, and with the accomplishment of such a work of judgment
as lies within their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82"
name="pb82">82</a>]</span>own horizon; to Isaiah the last troubles are
those of the Assyrian invasion; to Jeremiah the restoration follows on
the exile to Babylon; Daniel connects the future glory with the
overthrow of the Greek monarchy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2579src" href="#xd21e2579" name="xd21e2579src">8</a></p>
<p>Referring to non-Christian parallels to the belief in a Messiah,
Canon Cheyne draws special attention to a Babylonian parallel, and
concludes that &ldquo;it is historically very conceivable that a
Babylonian belief may be the real parent both of this and of all other
Messianic beliefs within the sphere of Babylonian
influence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2586src" href="#xd21e2586"
name="xd21e2586src">9</a></p>
<p>The manner in which these so-called prophets can be looked upon as
foretelling is explained elsewhere<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2593src"
href="#xd21e2593" name="xd21e2593src">10</a> as follows: &ldquo;The
prophets in the Old Testament, being inspired to interpret human needs,
became unconscious prophets of the Christ.... It is quite true that
prophecy explained in this way is no longer available for the truth of
Christianity to the same extent that it once was&mdash;at any rate, for
the convincing of unbelievers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>New Testament Chronology.</i>&mdash;We do not know exactly when
or where<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2603src" href="#xd21e2603" name=
"xd21e2603src">11</a> Jesus was born, when He died, or how long He
ministered. As to the birth of Jesus, the only account which claims to
give indications of date rests on a series of mistakes. No census was
possible under Herod, and none took place under &ldquo;Cyrenius&rdquo;
until <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 7. The only results which have a
high degree of probability are the date <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 30
for the death of Jesus, and the period of about one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>year&mdash;conservative opinion estimates it to be
three years&mdash;for the length of His public ministry.</p>
<p><i>The Virgin Birth.</i>&mdash;The Gospels themselves afford the
amplest justification for a criticism of their narratives. Jesus
Himself made no appeal to His supposed miraculous birth. The only two
verses in the first chapter of St. Luke which clearly express the idea
of a supernatural birth so disturb the connection that we are impelled
to regard them as an interpolation. It is Joseph, and not Mary, whose
descent is traced from the son of Jesse. The genealogy of Joseph, given
in the first Gospel, is prior in date to the story of the Virgin Birth,
and could have been drawn up only while he was regarded as the real
father of Jesus. Also St. Paul&rsquo;s statement that Jesus was born of
the seed of David according to the flesh cannot be reconciled with the
account of his having been born of a virgin. There is no recorded
adoration of the Virgin by St. Paul, or, for the matter of that, by any
of the Apostles or disciples.</p>
<p>Apologists point out that among the Jews, generally, the notion of
supernatural birth did not attach to their conception of the Messiah.
This is true; but in the school of thought of which Philo was head
there were traditions that every child of promise was born of a virgin.
Now Philo, the Hellenistic Jewish philosopher of Alexandria, was a
contemporary of Christ, and the influence of his school is not
disputed. Speaking of him in the article on Alexandria in his
<i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, Dr. Smith says: &ldquo;It is impossible
not to feel the important office which the mystic philosophy, of which
Philo is the representative, fulfilled in preparing for the
apprehension of the highest Christian truth.&rdquo; In the next chapter
we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>shall see that this &ldquo;mystic
philosophy&rdquo; sprang from a heathen source, and that for the whole
birth and childhood story of St. Matthew, in its every detail, it is
possible to trace a pagan substratum.</p>
<p><i>Jesus.</i>&mdash;Professor A. B. Bruce,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2632src" href="#xd21e2632" name="xd21e2632src">12</a> writer of
the article on &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; points out that, while the Gospels
may be regarded as, in the main, a trustworthy tradition, they are
unreliable in many of their details. Those details turn out to be the
all-important ones, for he goes on to show that: The Temptation is a
symbolic representation of a spiritual experience; the story of the
Crucifixion is not pure truth, but truth mixed with doubtful legend;
the night trial, the mocking, the incident of Barabbas, the two
thieves, and the preternatural concomitants of the death are
picturesque accessories of doubtful authenticity; Christ&rsquo;s
conceptions of Messiahship were greatly influenced by the later Isaiah;
while His spiritual intuitions are pure truth valid for all ages, His
language concerning the Father shows limitation of vision; His acts of
healing are considered to be real, though it does not follow that they
were miraculous. Referring to the strange statement that Jesus declined
to expound His parables to the people, lest they should be converted,
we are assured that &ldquo;it is not credible that Jesus would either
cherish or avow such an inhuman intention, though it is possible that
in His disappointment He may have expressed Himself in such a way as to
be misunderstood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is all very well; but, if this be granted, we are naturally
anxious to know in how many more matters Jesus may not have been
misunderstood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>What is the use of a revelation which can be
misunderstood in this way? What can be the motive of the Omnipotent
Revealer in allowing Himself to be misunderstood? Were not His hearers
who misunderstood Him His own selected expositors?</p>
<p>We even find suspicion thrown on the supposed early belief in the
divinity of Jesus. For the writer points out that, while in the Gospel
of St. Luke Jesus is called &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; about a dozen times,
the earlier Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark refer to Him simply as
&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a fact which seems to indicate the
gradual evolution of the belief in His divinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclusions of Professor Schmiedel, D.D., of Z&uuml;rich, one of
the writers of the article on the Gospels, are still more destructive.
He admits<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2643src" href="#xd21e2643" name=
"xd21e2643src">13</a> that his criticisms &ldquo;may have sometimes
raised a doubt whether any credible elements were to be found in the
Gospels at all,&rdquo; and that there are only nine passages which
&ldquo;might be called the foundation-pillars for a truly scientific
life of Jesus.&rdquo; He admits also &ldquo;the meagreness of the
historical testimony regarding Jesus,&rdquo; as well &ldquo;in
canonical writings outside of the Gospels&rdquo; as &ldquo;in profane
writers such as Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Pliny.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Resurrection.</i>&mdash;The all-important subject of the
&ldquo;Resurrection&rdquo; is treated by Professor Schmiedel, who tells
us that the Gospel accounts &ldquo;exhibit contradictions of the most
glaring kind.&rdquo; The actuality of the Resurrection depends for its
establishment upon these very narratives, and in such a case
unimpeachable witnesses are naturally demanded. Such witnesses do not
exist. The reality <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>of the appearances has ever been in dispute.
The account of the watch at the sepulchre and the sealing of the tomb
is now given up as unhistorical even by those who accept the story as a
whole. &ldquo;The statements as to the empty tomb are to be
rejected.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2655src" href="#xd21e2655"
name="xd21e2655src">14</a> The silence of St. Paul with regard to these
details is unaccountable, if the story of the Resurrection be true. For
him nothing less than the truth of Christianity rested on the actuality
of the Resurrection of Jesus. During his visit to Jerusalem he had had
opportunities of acquiring knowledge relating to it, and it may
naturally be assumed that, when endeavouring to prove to the
Corinthians the truth of the Resurrection, he would state fully and
clearly all that he knew about it. It is admitted on all hands that the
appearance recorded by him was in the nature of a vision&mdash;a purely
subjective experience. And it is well known that St. Paul uses the same
Greek word to describe both the appearance to himself and the
appearances to the original disciples, thereby implying the possibility
that the latter also were of a visionary or subjective character. An
apologetic tendency is perceptible in the Gospel account, and this may
help to explain the rise of unhistorical elements. It is probable that,
in the absence of knowledge, conjectures were freely made, and many
questions asked, the replies to which were afterwards assumed to be
facts.</p>
<p><i>The Gospels.</i>&mdash;The article on the Gospels by Dr. E. A.
Abbott<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2665src" href="#xd21e2665" name=
"xd21e2665src">15</a> and Professor Schmiedel is crowded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>with
damaging criticism. The view hitherto current that the four Gospels
were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and appeared thirty or
forty years after the death of Jesus, can, it is stated, no longer be
maintained. The four Gospels were compiled from earlier materials which
have perished, and the dates when they first appeared in their present
form are given as follows:&mdash;Mark, certainly after the destruction
of Jerusalem in the year 70<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2670src" href=
"#xd21e2670" name="xd21e2670src">16</a>; Matthew, about 119
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>; Luke, between 100 and 110; and John,
between 132 and 140. But, even if we accept more conservative opinions
which place the earliest Gospel about 65 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>,
that would not, of course, make any material difference, nor affect the
conclusions of criticism as to their <i>contents</i>. Some of their
statements of fact are quite erroneous, and the data are often in
direct contradiction to one another. The evangelists made it clear that
they wrote with a &ldquo;lack of concern for historical
precision.&rdquo; The imperfection of the Gospel accounts is everywhere
manifest. Even if His ministry lasted only a few months, He must have
said a thousandfold more, and repeated His sayings with many
variations. The text must not be taken as a trustworthy guide to His
original meaning. It merely shows us what the evangelists or their
predecessors believed him to mean. The situations in which the words of
Jesus are said to have been spoken cannot be implicitly accepted.</p>
<p>Both St. Matthew and St. Mark seem to have read <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>into the
utterances of Jesus details borrowed from subsequent facts or
controversies. The historical value of the third Gospel is lowered by
evidence of the writer&rsquo;s errors and misunderstandings. It has
been widely assumed that it was written by the physician Luke, and that
Luke was a companion of Paul. This view of its Pauline character,
however, can now be maintained only in a very limited sense. It is
clear that the third Gospel and the Acts are by the same author, but
that author was not Luke. In the fourth Gospel we find more ambiguities
than in all the other three together. The story of the raising of
Lazarus cannot be considered historical. The common-sense view of the
Synoptic omission of the raising of Lazarus is that earlier authors
omitted the tradition because they did not accept it, and probably had
never heard of it. &ldquo;Is, then, the record of the raising of
Lazarus a fiction?&rdquo; asks Dr. Abbott. &ldquo;Not a fiction, for it
is a development. But it is non-historical, like the history of the
Creation in Genesis, and like the records of the other miracles in the
fourth Gospel, all of which are poetic developments.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2687src" href="#xd21e2687" name=
"xd21e2687src">17</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we are plainly warned that &ldquo;it is vain to look to the
Church fathers for trustworthy information on the subject of the origin
of the Gospels.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2694src" href=
"#xd21e2694" name="xd21e2694src">18</a> This is an exceedingly grave
admission when we remember that these same untrustworthy fathers of the
Church did the work of sifting the wheat from the chaff&mdash;settling
what was and what was not canonical.</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that these general conclusions, which are
supported by evidence that has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"
href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>satisfied numerous Christian
scholars, entirely do away with the idea that the Gospels are credible
and trustworthy narratives.</p>
<p><i>The Acts of the Apostles.</i>&mdash;The sections of this book in
which the narrative is written in the first person plural (says
Professor Schmiedel) can be implicitly accepted; but it is equally
certain that they are not by the same hand as the rest of the book.
Apart from the &ldquo;we&rdquo; sections, no statement merits immediate
acceptance on the mere ground of its presence in the book. The speeches
are constructed by the author in accordance with his own conceptions.
This book does not come from a companion of St. Paul; its date may be
set down as between <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 105 and 130.</p>
<p><i>The Epistles of St. Paul.</i>&mdash;The genuineness of the
Pauline Epistles does not appear to be so clear as was once universally
supposed. Advanced criticism, Professor van Manen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2715src" href="#xd21e2715" name="xd21e2715src">19</a> tells us,
in his elaborate article on &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; has learned to
recognise that none of these Epistles is by him, not even the four
generally regarded as unassailable. Van Manen&rsquo;s position,
however, is exceptional. In the article on &ldquo;Epistolary
Literature&rdquo; the Epistle to Philemon and the Epistles to the
Philippians, Thessalonians, Galatians, Colossians, Ephesians, and even
the Epistle to the Romans, are recognised as real letters written by
St. Paul. The genuineness of four of the Epistles is, in any case,
generally accepted. As these include the first Epistle to the
Corinthians, this conclusion is of the greatest importance. The Bishop
of London is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>&ldquo;content to rest his case, for not being
intellectually ashamed of the documentary evidence, on the four
undisputed Epistles of St. Paul.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2720src" href="#xd21e2720" name="xd21e2720src">20</a></p>
<p><i>The Apocalypse.</i>&mdash;Criticism has clearly shown that the
Book of Revelation can no longer be regarded as a literary unit, but is
an admixture of Jewish with Christian ideas and speculations. Ancient
testimony, that of Papias in particular, assumed the Presbyter John,
and not the Apostle, to be its author.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>This completes a summary of conclusions, arrived at by eminent
Christian scholars of the more advanced school. Though they, or the
majority of them, would be the last to make any such admission, the net
result amounts practically to a surrender of the Christian dogmas.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 3. <i>By Whom the &ldquo;Higher
Criticism&rdquo; is Accepted.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These criticisms are, I repeat, the work not of
anti-Christians, but of Christians, who have devoted themselves to
Biblical research, and who are among the greatest living experts in
that sphere of knowledge. Canon Cheyne, one of the two editors of the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i>, has now written a volume on <i>Bible
Problems and the New Material for their Solution</i>, in which he
appeals to Churchmen and scholars and all who are interested in Bible
criticism for thoroughness of investigation. There can be no doubt that
there is a crying need for this thorough investigation, which at
present is being shirked. While the main results arrived at by the
Higher Criticism are, it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>true, largely accepted by enlightened
divines, the usual policy so far has been not to disseminate such
knowledge. On this I shall have more to say in the concluding chapter
of this book.</p>
<p>Dr. Harnack in Germany, and M. Loisy in France, may be cited as
types of liberal theologians who proclaim their acceptance of the
Higher Criticism. They both detach Christianity from mere narrative,
and seek to appreciate it as a spiritual reality, which appeals to the
imagination, the emotions, and the soul. Dr. Harnack is the Professor
of Church History in the University of Berlin, and member of the Royal
Prussian Academy, and a book called <i>What is Christianity?</i> is an
English translation of sixteen lectures delivered by him in the
University of Berlin, 1899&ndash;1900. In this book the effort to prove
that the Gospels though unhistorical are yet historical, that
Christianity though untrue is yet true, is strongly in evidence to any
impartial reader. Take his remark on the &ldquo;Miraculous
Element&rdquo; in Lecture II.; we find the same kind of specious
argument on which I have already animadverted in the chapter on
Miracles. He says: &ldquo;Miracles, it is true, do not happen; but of
the marvellous and the inexplicable there is no lack&mdash;that the
earth in its course stood still, that a she-ass spoke, that a <i>storm
was quieted by a word</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2754src" href=
"#xd21e2754" name="xd21e2754src">21</a> we do not believe, and we shall
never again believe; but that the lame walked, the blind saw, and the
deaf heard, will not be so summarily dismissed as an illusion.&rdquo;
Why? Because, after all, these may have been accomplished by the
operation of a natural law with which we are as yet unacquainted!
&ldquo;Although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>the order of Nature be inviolable, we are not yet
by any means acquainted with all the forces working in it and acting
reciprocally with other forces. Our acquaintance even with the forces
inherent in matter, and with the field of their action, is incomplete;
while of psychic forces we know very much less.&rdquo; He gives the
whole situation away, however, by making <i>excuses for the
Evangelists</i>, such as &ldquo;<i>we know that the Gospels come from a
time in which the marvellous may be said to have been something of
almost daily occurrence</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>we now know that
eminent persons have not to wait until they have been long dead, or
even for several years, to have miracles reported of them; they are
reported at once, often the very next day</i>.&rdquo; Again, speaking
of the first three Gospels, he says: &ldquo;These Gospels are not, it
is true, historical works any more than the fourth; <i>they were not
written with the simple object of giving the facts as they were; they
were books composed for the work of evangelisation</i>.&rdquo; Such
reasoning serves only to confirm one&rsquo;s suspicions. Here is the
unedifying spectacle of an erudite scholar using his intellectual
powers to make out a case for a Faith built upon foundations which he
has himself destroyed. We do not wish to be told that there is a
substratum of truth in the Gospel narratives. The ordinary man feels
strongly that the whole should be true if it be God&rsquo;s Word. That
this is, and always will be, the common-sense view of mankind is proved
by the fact that it is held by the vast majority of the strictly
orthodox, as well as by every Agnostic and every cultured heathen.</p>
<p>M. Loisy writes in much the same strain as Dr. Harnack, and finds
adherents in both English and Roman Catholic Churches, as may be seen
from the correspondence in the <i>Church Times</i> during April, 1904.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> (January, 1905) an Oxfordshire rector,
the Rev. C. J. Shebbeare, presents the same aspect of liberal theology
by means of various illustrations. He remarks: &ldquo;It is evident
that the lesson taught by our new teachers must have an important
bearing upon popular religious conceptions and upon religious practice.
<i>Its chief effect will be to deliver us from the error of identifying
religion with belief in the supernatural&mdash;an error of which it is
not difficult to see the pernicious consequences</i>&rdquo; (italics
are mine). This is all very well for those who can divest the Christian
religion of its supernatural element, and yet remain honest believers.
To my mind, this is simply non-Christian Theism, and the Theistic
Church, Swallow Street, is the place where such persons should perform
their devotions.</p>
<p>I crave the reader&rsquo;s patience while I give one more example of
advanced apologetics. The Rev. Arthur Moorhouse, M.A., B.D., Tutor in
Old Testament Languages and Literature at Didsbury College, offers, in
a lecture<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2788src" href="#xd21e2788" name=
"xd21e2788src">22</a> delivered at Manchester on &ldquo;The Inspiration
of the Old Testament,&rdquo; &ldquo;an unhesitating and emphatic
denial&rdquo; to the statement that there is any &ldquo;untruth in the
Old Testament.&rdquo; Yet he tells us that &ldquo;the early chapters of
Genesis are not historical in our modern and scientific sense,&rdquo;
and asks us to remember that, &ldquo;in the nature of things, it could
not be history, for it deals with facts which are, of necessity,
prehistoric&rdquo;! Such pitiful shifts and evasions seem to many of us
wholly unworthy of earnest men. &ldquo;Our fathers,&rdquo; says Mr.
Moorhouse, &ldquo;may have thought that this was history miraculously
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>dictated, but the Bible does not say so.&rdquo;
No, and the Bible does not say that it is speaking the truth, but
&ldquo;our fathers&rdquo; were simple-minded enough to forget that such
a guarantee was necessary on the part of a book which they, like Mr.
Moorhouse, believed to be the inspired Word of God.</p>

Apologists.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I cannot conclude this review of Bible criticism
without an allusion to the opinions of those theologians who agree with
the &ldquo;Higher Critics&rdquo; to an extent far exceeding anything
the pious layman suspects. I shall omit, as being too advanced, the
views of Dr. Driver, given in his &ldquo;Genesis,&rdquo; or of Canon
Henson, as expressed in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> and in his book,
<i>The Value of the Bible and Other Sermons</i>, or of Archdeacon
Wilson, shown in his various interesting books and pamphlets; and will
confine myself to comparatively conservative theology. I select, as
representative of this type, <i>The Divine Library of the Old
Testament</i>, by Dr. A. F. Kirkpatrick (Master of Selwyn College,
Regius Professor of Hebrew in the University of Cambridge, and Canon of
Ely Cathedral), and <i>The Study of the Gospels</i>, being a
&ldquo;Handbook for the Clergy,&rdquo; by Dr. J. Armitage Robinson
(Dean of Westminster).</p>
<p>In the former, which is among the books selected by the Christian
Evidence Society for their Examination in March, 1907, we read:
&ldquo;The lectures do not attempt to deal with many of the graver
questions which are being raised as to the Old Testament.&rdquo; But it
is just the more difficult questions, such as those examined with such
destructive effect by the Higher Criticism, which specially require to
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>answered. Why are they neglected? The author goes
on to confess that &ldquo;the books were constructed out of earlier
narratives; some were formed by the union of previous collections of
poetry or prophecies; some betray marks of a reviser&rsquo;s hand; and
even books which bear the names of well-known authors in some cases
contain matter which must be attributed to other writers.&rdquo; Also
we find the following significant admissions. Referring to the
important last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah, he accepts Dr.
Driver&rsquo;s criticisms, and says: &ldquo;I do not see how we can
resist the conclusion that these chapters were not written by Isaiah,
but by an unknown prophet towards the close of the Babylonian
Exile&rdquo;; and he owns that &ldquo;it will inevitably seem to many
students of the Bible that, in assigning the prophecy to a date so near
to the events which it foretells, we are detracting from its truly
predictive character and diminishing its value.&rdquo; However, he
considers that &ldquo;Isaiah is great enough to share his glory with
this disciple, in whom, being dead, he yet spoke; and, paradox as it
may seem, the truly prophetic character of the work gains by being
referred to the time of the Exile.&rdquo; By what process of reasoning
he arrives at this astonishing conclusion it is exceedingly difficult
to comprehend.</p>
<p>Further admissions by Dr. Kirkpatrick must be noticed more briefly.
They are: &ldquo;The first chapter of Genesis is not, as we now know, a
scientifically exact account of Creation.&rdquo; &ldquo;The account of
the Fall is, it may be, an allegory rather than a history in the strict
sense of the term.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Deluge was not universal in the
sense that the waters covered the whole surface of the entire
globe.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Psalms, like the Proverbs, have a long
literary history. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"
name="pb96">96</a>]</span>They are poems by different authors, and
David may be one of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Modern criticism claims, and
claims with justice, that the Hexateuch, like so many of the other
books, is composite in its origin, and has a long literary
history.&rdquo; &ldquo;That the Pentateuch was entirely written by
Moses is merely a Jewish tradition, which passed into the Christian
Church and was commonly accepted until modern times. [Yet how much
hangs upon the trustworthiness of this same Jewish tradition, and how
much else may not the Church have wrongfully accepted?] Some of the
variations of the LXX.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2823src" href=
"#xd21e2823" name="xd21e2823src">23</a> from the Hebrew text are due,
no doubt, to errors and interpolations and deliberate alterations; but
after all allowance has been made for these, I do not see how any
candid critic can resist the conclusion that many of them represent
variations existing in the Hebrew text from which the translation was
made.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was probably at the very beginning of this
period [from the Fall of Jerusalem to the end of the fifth century],
towards the close of the first century a.d., that the final settlement
of an authoritative text took place.... How came it that all the copies
containing other readings have disappeared?... Copies differing from it
[the standard text] would die out or be deliberately destroyed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The oldest Hebrew MS. in existence of which the date is known
was written in 916 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
separated by more than a thousand years from the latest of the works
included in the Canon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, the following crucial questions are offered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>(pp.
88&ndash;9) <i>and left unanswered</i>: &ldquo;In what sense, it is
asked, can this legislation, which is now said to be Mosaic in
elemental germ and idea only, and to represent not the inspired
deliverance of a supremely great individual, but the painful efforts of
many generations of law-makers; these histories which have been
compiled from primitive traditions, and chronicles, and annals, and
what not; these books of prophecy which are not the authentic
autographs of the prophets, but posthumous collections of such writings
(if any) as they left behind them, eked out by the recollections of
their disciples; these Proverbs and Psalms which have been handed down
by tradition and altered and edited and re-edited; these histories
which contain errors of date and fact, and have been, perhaps,
&lsquo;idealised&rsquo; by the reflection of the circumstances and
ideas of the writer&rsquo;s own times upon a distant past; these
seeming narratives which may be allegories; and these would-be
prophecies which may be histories; in what sense can these be said to
be <i>inspired</i>? The problems raised are grave.&rdquo; My own
thoughts, and the thoughts of many like myself, are here candidly
expressed. I have nothing to add, and can only echo this learned
divine&rsquo;s solemn words&mdash;the problems raised are grave!</p>
<p>Turning now to the <i>Study of the Gospels</i>, we learn from Dr.
Robinson as follows: There is no proof that St. Matthew is the author
of the first Gospel. He is unable to fix the date himself, but quotes
Dr. Harnack, who says &ldquo;probably 70&ndash;75,&rdquo; and who also
adds the important reservation, &ldquo;except certain later
additions.&rdquo; St. Mark&rsquo;s authorship, he thinks, is
practically certain, and the year 65 is the probable date. &ldquo;It
is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;exceedingly probable that St. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>Peter
would not write or preach, even if he could speak at all, in any
language but his mother tongue, the Aramaic of Galilee, a local dialect
akin to Hebrew. When he wrote or preached to Greek-speaking people, he
would use Mark or some other disciple as his interpreter.&rdquo; What,
then, may I ask, had become of the &ldquo;gifts at
Pentecost&rdquo;?</p>
<p>St. Luke is, according to Dr. Robinson, the fellow-traveller of St.
Paul, and the date of his Gospel shortly after 70. Regarding St.
John&rsquo;s, we are informed that Dr. Harnack fixes the date between
80 and 110, and thinks that it was written by another person of the
same name&mdash;John the presbyter, or elder, of Ephesus. Dr. Robinson,
however, in a chapter he devotes to the subject of the fourth Gospel,
attempts to show its apostolic authorship.</p>
<p>Dr. Robinson admits that the authorship of all four Gospels is
doubtful, but thinks that, regarding the second Gospel, we may accept
the second-century tradition that it was written by St. Mark, and that
St. Mark was the &ldquo;interpreter&rdquo; of St. Peter and wrote the
Gospel in Rome from information derived from that Apostle. Very good;
let us accept this conclusion. We have it, then, that <i>one</i> of the
Gospels is from the mouth of an eye-witness. This eye-witness, however,
was, after all, an eye-witness of only one year (or, according to
conservative criticism, three years) of Christ&rsquo;s life; he was an
illiterate person, and the information he imparted after thirty or
forty years had to be written down by another person in another
language, and there is no telling how faithful or unfaithful the
translation may have been. Besides, as Dr. Robinson points out in his
chapters on &ldquo;The Great Sermon&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Non-Marcan
Document,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>there are very important omissions in St.
Mark&rsquo;s Gospel. Referring to a supposed source for the information
furnished by other evangelists, but omitted by St. Mark, he says:
&ldquo;You may gain some general idea of the scope of this document
(the Non-Marcan<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2861src" href="#xd21e2861"
name="xd21e2861src">24</a>) by underlining in St. Luke&rsquo;s Gospel
all those portions which are to be found in St. Matthew, but are not to
be found in St. Mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, what are these omissions in St. Mark? Are they trivial? Let us
judge for ourselves by taking a few selections. There is no mention
whatever of the story of Christ&rsquo;s miraculous birth, nor of the
other incidents of His childhood which are said to be in fulfilment of
prophecy, and there is no mention of the great Sermon on the Mount. The
story of the Resurrection is told in a few sentences, and the Ascension
in one sentence. Unfortunately, too, these very sentences are
admittedly interpolations, and St. Mark really ends at xvi. 8.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2872src" href="#xd21e2872" name=
"xd21e2872src">25</a> So there is no account of either the Incarnation,
Resurrection, or Ascension, and we are left with oral traditions,
&ldquo;lost&rdquo; documents, and unknown copyists, as the only source
from which to obtain any detailed information concerning the very
groundwork of our Creed! Could anything be more unsatisfactory, more
calculated to arouse suspicion of the &ldquo;Christian
Verities&rdquo;&mdash;the Gospel truths? I am completely at a loss to
understand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>how the Bishop of Gloucester<a class="noteref"
id="n112src" href="#n112" name="n112src">26</a> can say that the
&ldquo;Higher Criticism&rdquo; has been a &ldquo;gain to the
Church,&rdquo; or the Bishop of London<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n112">26</a> that &ldquo;the New Testament stands ten times as strong
as it did fifty years ago.&rdquo; It would seem to be a case of
&ldquo;where ignorance is bliss,&rdquo; etc., or else of the wish being
father to the thought.</p>
<p>There is much more that I should wish to call attention to, did
space permit, but I have now, I think, given some insight into modern
Bible criticism, and the extent to which it is accepted by Christians.
It only remains, in conclusion, to ask for earnest thought on this new
aspect of &ldquo;the Word of God.&rdquo; In doing so the following
additional considerations may be borne in mind.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The orthodox and traditional view of the Old Testament
is preserved in the unrepealed &ldquo;Blasphemy Act,&rdquo; 9 and 10,
William III., cap. 32, which enacts that any person who shall deny the
&ldquo;Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament&rdquo; to be of
&ldquo;divine authority&rdquo; shall be incapable of holding any public
office or employment, and shall, on a second conviction, also suffer
imprisonment for a space of three years. The Vatican Council of 1870,
&ldquo;speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,&rdquo;
declared that the books of the Old and New Testament &ldquo;have God
for their author, and, as such, have been delivered to the
Church.&rdquo; The Council, therefore, ordained that the man should be
anathema who refused &ldquo;to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101"
href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>receive, for sacred and
canonical, the books of the Holy Scripture in their integrity, with all
their parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bayley expressed the opinion of his day when he wrote<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2905src" href="#xd21e2905" name=
"xd21e2905src">27</a>: &ldquo;The Bible cannot be less than verbally
inspired. Every word, every syllable, every letter, is just what it
would be had God spoken from heaven without any human intervention.
Every scientific statement is infallibly correct; all its history and
narratives of every kind are without any inaccuracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listen, again, to the words of a well-known divine of our own
Church, spoken but yesterday: &ldquo;The whole of the teaching of the
New Testament is based upon the supposition that God made a covenant
with Abraham.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2916src" href=
"#xd21e2916" name="xd21e2916src">28</a> &ldquo;You have our Lord Jesus
Christ building His whole life on the Scriptures, and submitting to
death in obedience to them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2919src"
href="#xd21e2919" name="xd21e2919src">29</a> This is the strictly
orthodox opinion, and it is consistent with Christian doctrine. Yet,
for obvious reasons, the Old Testament is now regarded as an incubus by
an increasing number of earnest Christians.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are many cruel sayings attributed to
Jesus. Only the few are to be saved from the eternal torments of the
damned (St. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=

etc.). Happily, owing to the rise of Rationalism and the consequent
subjection of the Bible to criticism, the dogma of eternal torment is
disputed on all sides, and the Athanasian Creed will soon no longer be
forced upon us. The principle of the &ldquo;chosen few&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>is so clearly Christ&rsquo;s teaching, and
furnishes such a convenient explanation for the attitude of the many,
that it is commonly adhered to; but liberal theologians no longer hold
that &ldquo;he that believeth not shall be damned,&rdquo; or that the
punishment of the sinner is to be excruciating torture for all
eternity. Unbelievers and sinners may all ultimately be saved, or at
the worst their existence will end with this life. Good, very good;
such views appeal to us as being more humane and rational; but are they
compatible with the truth of the Bible? Mark the words of the late
Bishop of Manchester: &ldquo;The very foundation of our Faith, the very
basis of our hopes, are taken from us when one line of that sacred
volume, on which we base everything, is declared to be untruthful and
untrustworthy.&rdquo; Thus it is that there are many who would still
retain the inhuman doctrines ascribed to the Master. Fearful of losing
the basis of their hopes, and unconscious, apparently, of their sublime
egoism, they reason, and reason with logic: We must accept the whole or
reject the whole.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">SILENCE OF HISTORIANS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the Bible should be open to criticism at all
seems to me inconceivable if it really be <i>God&rsquo;s</i> gift to
mankind. How could God, having determined after &aelig;ons of time to
make a definite revelation of Himself to His human creatures, permit
the account of this revelation to be handed down in such a haphazard
fashion that future generations cannot be sure that they possess a
reliable record? This, too, when a trustworthy record was the more
essential on account of the miraculous nature of the narrative. As
Professor Schmiedel remarks, the meagreness of the historical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>testimony regarding Jesus, whether in canonical
writings outside of the Gospels or in profane writers such as Josephus,
Tacitus, Suetonius, and Pliny, is most pronounced. Not a single passage
can be produced from the writings of the great historians and
philosophers who flourished between <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 40 and
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 140 which makes the slightest allusion to
the astounding phenomena connected with the birth, resurrection, and
ascension of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>It was at one time claimed that Josephus spoke of Jesus. That this
has been given up by theologians may be verified by a reference to
Canon Farrar&rsquo;s <i>Life of Christ</i>, vol. i., p. 63 (and p. 31
of the cheap edition), where we read that &ldquo;The single passage in
which he (Josephus) alludes to Him is interpolated, if not wholly
spurious.&rdquo; There is also a disputed passage<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2963src" href="#xd21e2963" name="xd21e2963src">30</a> in Tacitus,
where he speaks of Christians having &ldquo;their denomination from
Christus, who, in the reign of Tiberius, was put to death as a criminal
by the procurator, Pontius Pilate.&rdquo; And that is all! Could
anything be more disappointing than this must be to thoughtful
Christians who wish to establish the historical accuracy of the
miraculous story of God&rsquo;s life on earth? Eusebius (<span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 315&ndash;340), the celebrated ecclesiastical
historian, is apparently reduced to appealing to a Pagan oracle for a
proof of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, for he says to the heathen:
&ldquo;But thou at least listen to thine own gods, to thy oracular
deities themselves, who have borne witness, and ascribed to our Saviour
(Jesus Christ) not imposture, but piety and wisdom, and ascent into
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence of secular historians is accounted for, by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>certain divines, by falling back on a theory of
hostility or contempt. Thus Dean Farrar thinks that Josephus&rsquo;s
silence on the subject of Jesus and Christianity was as deliberate as
it was dishonest (see his <i>Life of Christ</i>, vol. i., p. 63).
Except that this offers a much-needed explanation, I am not cognisant
of any reason for suspecting the famous <i>secular</i> historian,
although, of course, the untrustworthiness of the <i>Christian</i>
historians is notorious. Eusebius, for example, the gravest of the
ecclesiastical historians, confesses, with commendable frankness:
&ldquo;We have decided to relate nothing concerning them [the early
Christians] except the things in which we can vindicate the divine
judgment.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2982src" href="#xd21e2982"
name="xd21e2982src">31</a></p>
<p>With regard to the prodigy of the darkness, etc., that occurred at
the death of Jesus, Gibbon informs us as follows: &ldquo;It happened
during the lifetime of Seneca and the elder Pliny, who must have
experienced the immediate effects, or received the earliest
intelligence of the prodigy. Each of these philosophers, in a laborious
work, has recorded all the great phenomena of Nature&mdash;earthquakes,
meteors, comets, and eclipses&mdash;which his indefatigable curiosity
could collect. But the one and the other has omitted to mention the
greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye has been witness since the
creation of the globe.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2993src" href=
"#xd21e2993" name="xd21e2993src">32</a> Any attempt to explain this
away by supposing that the darkness of three hours was local
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>only detracts from the magnitude of the miracle,
which was intended, by its very magnitude, to be one of the proofs of
the death of a God.</p>

<h4 class="main">THOUGHTS ON &ldquo;TRADITION&rdquo; AS GOD&rsquo;S
METHOD FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF TRUTH TO POSTERITY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Have you ever, in the days of your early youth, played
the game of &ldquo;gossip&rdquo;? It is an amusing game, and also
points a moral. A number of persons put themselves in a long row, and
the first will think of some little incident, which he will carefully
whisper to his neighbour, who will then pass it on, and so on, and so
on, till it reaches the last person, who will proceed to repeat out
loud the story he has heard. The original story will then be divulged,
and much amusement is caused by the differences that are found between
the two stories. This illustration of what occurs in
&ldquo;gossip&rdquo; came back to my mind with much misgiving when I
first heard how the story of my Saviour&rsquo;s life on earth was
handed down for a long period &ldquo;by tradition.&rdquo; Apparently,
Christian theologians look quite complacently, and without any
misgiving, upon this process for the transmission of the Christian
verities; but, for myself, whether it were a century, or whether it
were only a matter of thirty or forty years, before the final committal
to writing, it was a heartrending discovery, and all my confidence in
the truth of the Bible story was shaken. My dismay was not diminished
when I learnt also that it was extremely doubtful whether the authors
were eye-witnesses of the events, or especially inspired by God for
their task; also, that there had been subsequent interpolations by
equally unknown and uninspired writers, who, to speak plainly, were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>nothing more nor less than forgers, actuated,
possibly, by pious motives. That the writers of the Gospels were
vouchsafed any unusual facilities through the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit is discredited by the remarks of the apologists themselves.
Thus, Dr. Robinson, in his book already referred to, alludes to St.
Peter&rsquo;s illiteracy, St. Mark&rsquo;s poor literary attainments,
and the limitations to which all the evangelists in ancient times were
subjected.</p>
<p>We find ourselves asking the questions, &ldquo;Did not God know that
a time would come when we should discover that nature&rsquo;s laws were
not of the fragile or elastic character which our forefathers had
supposed? Did He not know that we should therefore require absolute
proof before we could believe that they had been broken in a bygone and
credulous age?&rdquo; Instead of this, the only proofs afforded us are
copies of documents concocted from hearsay&mdash;we are not sure when
or by whom&mdash;and from time to time fraudulently manipulated by
interested though &ldquo;pious&rdquo; forgers. Did He, in His
Omniscience, purposely allow events to take their course, and intend
the story of His Son&rsquo;s life upon earth to be handed down to us by
the same unsatisfactory process as that of many another ancient
tradition now known to be historically worthless? If ever special
interference with the course of nature were necessary, surely it would
be here&mdash;a miracle to prove the miracle on which our hopes are
staked. Or, if this be asking too much, if it be argued that it is no
longer God&rsquo;s pleasure to break the laws which He has made, and
that He now accomplishes His purposes by means of these laws only, how
comes it that, for the safeguarding of this great truth, the most
ordinary precautions have been neglected? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>We are often asked to consider the yearnings of man as a proof that
the thing yearned for is a reality. His yearnings, therefore, are not a
negligible quantity. Do not, then, the yearnings of millions of
Christians in the Roman Catholic and Greek Churches for miraculous
proofs of God&rsquo;s residence once upon earth count for something?
Are not all the &ldquo;miraculous&rdquo; relics and
&ldquo;wonder-working&rdquo; ikons a proof that man feels that
God&rsquo;s revelation ought to be assured to us by the continuance of
miracles? In our own Church, Holman Hunt&rsquo;s painting of &ldquo;The
Light of the World&rdquo; is being sent round our colonies, to
strengthen people&rsquo;s belief in Jesus Christ. Why, oh why, have we
not the real picture of our Saviour, bringing our God nearer to us, and
enabling us to focus our thoughts on Him? I once mentioned my feeling
on this subject to a clergyman, a doctor of divinity, well versed in
Church history. He replied by suggesting that there was a tradition
which indicated that the true likeness of our Lord <i>had</i> been
miraculously transmitted, and that from this the great Italian painters
had caught their inspiration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3016src" href=
"#xd21e3016" name="xd21e3016src">33</a> It seems hardly necessary to
have recourse to the supernatural when there were natural sources
available in the shape of representations of pagan gods. Thus Mercury,
attired as a shepherd, with a lamb upon his shoulders, was no
infrequent object in ancient art, and this has, in some cases, led to a
difficulty in distinguishing between Mercury and Jesus Christ.
Similarly we know that the pictures and sculptures wherein Isis is
represented in the act of suckling her child Horus formed the
foundation for the Christian figures and paintings of the Madonna and
child. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=

<h4 class="main">THE ALLEGED SINLESSNESS OF JESUS CHRIST.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It may be urged that we have, what is of far more
importance, the picture of His character. Have we? The absolute
sinlessness of Christ is one of the chief proofs held out to us of His
divinity. It is described as being in itself a miracle so great that it
furnishes us with sufficient grounds for belief in other miracles. Many
pious and learned theists feel that the character of Christ as
portrayed in the Gospels betrays imperfections. But let this pass. What
do we know of His life? Let us assume that in the Gospel of St. Mark we
are put in possession of the impressions of an eye-witness. St.
Peter&rsquo;s personal knowledge of the <i>private</i> life of Jesus
was confined to his recollections concerning a beloved Master during
the period of His <i>public</i> ministry. And that ministry extended
over one year, or at most three years. Have not the disciples of great
teachers in the past invariably extolled the perfections of their
masters? Have they ever dwelt upon their imperfections? Has not the
picture handed down by tradition, and afterwards committed to writing,
often been that of a perfect man? That the writers of the Gospels
recognised the need for Christ to appear sinless, and adopted
questionable methods for their purpose, is only too evident. Dr.
Robinson explains<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3032src" href="#xd21e3032"
name="xd21e3032src">34</a> the disappearance from the other Gospels of
St. Mark&rsquo;s references to &ldquo;anger,&rdquo;
&ldquo;grief,&rdquo; &ldquo;groaning,&rdquo; &ldquo;vehemence,&rdquo;
etc., as being &ldquo;the result of a kind of reverence which belonged
to a slightly later stage of reflection, when certain traits might even
seem derogatory to the dignity of the sacred character.&rdquo; Comment
is superfluous. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"

<h4 class="main">THE IGNORANCE OF JESUS CHRIST.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is another difficulty of belief in the divinity
of Christ, which it is all the more essential to bring into prominence
because it usually receives but scant notice from the pulpit. I refer
to the &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo; of Jesus Christ. In a review of <i lang=
"fr">Le R&eacute;alisme Chr&eacute;tien et l&rsquo;Id&eacute;alisme
Grec</i>, par L. Laberthonni&egrave;re, the <i>Church Times</i> praises
the Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s conception of Christian realism, and then goes
on to say: &ldquo;Here is found the key to the mystery of the ignorance
of Jesus Christ, and of the other limitations attributed to Him in the
Gospels. There are two untenable theories&mdash;the one that He
deliberately kept things back from His disciples; the other that He was
Himself ignorant of His own true nature, which afterwards became known
to the Church. The truth is that He had to reveal Himself by living
among men, and not by giving them an abstract doctrine about
Himself&mdash;a doctrine which must have been either inadequate because
adjusted to their comprehension, or else incomprehensible because
adjusted to a reality which was beyond them.&rdquo; The plain question,
however, is&mdash;Had He, or had He not, the attribute of Omniscience?
Did He, or did He not, know what we now know? Are we to suppose that He
pretended to be ignorant? Was He God or was He man? The usual answer is
that, as Very Man, He had only the knowledge of His age (or, should we
not say, of the very restricted environment selected by Himself for His
activities upon earth?), but that as Very God he performed miracles,
taught spiritually, as never man taught, and was sinless. This answer,
however, would not be accepted by the Venerable W. M. Sinclair,
Archdeacon of London, who conjectures that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>&ldquo;when our Lord said, &lsquo;Greater works
than these shall ye do,&rsquo; He was perhaps thinking of the
marvellous discoveries of surgeons and physicians in times of advanced
science&rdquo; [!].<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3053src" href=
"#xd21e3053" name="xd21e3053src">35</a> Nor would it be accepted by the
Rev. David Smith, who holds that Jesus accommodated Himself to the
popular idea, and &ldquo;after His wont fell in with the
delusion&rdquo; [!].<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3056src" href=
"#xd21e3056" name="xd21e3056src">36</a></p>
<p>Surely an Omniscient God must have known that grave doubts would
arise in the future from the real or apparent ignorance of His Son,
and, <i>vice versa</i>, that any prescience shown by Him would be
hailed with delight as a proof of His divinity. If it be urged that
such trials of faith are useful, why should it be the thoughtful of
future generations who are chiefly to be so tried? If Christ had chosen
His disciples from among the &ldquo;wise men of the East&rdquo; (or
West), instead of from among men of the lowest order of intelligence
and education, there would then have been no necessity for the doctrine
to &ldquo;have been either inadequate because adjusted to their
comprehension, or else incomprehensible because adjusted to a reality
which was beyond them.&rdquo; Only a very small and remote corner of
the world was favoured by the presence of God when revealing Himself in
human form for the benefit of mankind. Only the most ignorant, for the
most part, heard His personal teaching. Had He revealed Himself to all,
or to a far greater number of persons then living, and satisfied the
ardent longings of the wise men and philosophers of those times, would
this not have conduced to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>rapid recognition of
Christianity and to its firm establishment over the whole world for all
ages?</p>
<p>The tiny Sea of Galilee, the birthplace of the Gospel, is only about
twelve miles long and seven miles in its widest part, and Chorazin,
Bethsaida, and Capernaum were all situated close together at the
northern end. Here Jesus made his permanent home after His
fellow-townsmen at Nazareth had rejected Him; here He preached, and
here He performed many mighty works. Not till I had visited the spot
did I fully realise the insignificance of the area to which the Saviour
of mankind confined His ministry. Round the lake stood such important
cities as Tiberias and Tariche&aelig;. They were studiously avoided by
Jesus. (This would account, perhaps, for their great men hearing
nothing of the new teaching, though hardly for their hearing nothing of
stupendous miracles performed at their very door.) The cities of the
Decapolis were also flourishing in this neighbourhood at the time of
Christ&rsquo;s ministry, and were the centre of great literary
activity. Gadara produced Philodemus the Epicurean, a contemporary of
Cicero; Meleager the epigrammatist; Menippus the satirist; Theodorus
the rhetorician, the tutor of Tiberius; and others. Gerasa, also, was a
mother of great teachers. In the words of George Adam Smith:
&ldquo;Philodemus, Meleager, Menippus, Theodorus, were names of which
one end of the Lake of Galilee was proud, when Matthew, Peter, James,
and John were working at the other end.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3071src" href="#xd21e3071" name="xd21e3071src">37</a> If it be
argued that for some inscrutable reason God sent His Son only to the
lost sheep <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>of the house of Israel and intended His
preaching to reach the Gentiles through the medium of His chosen
people, why was such a learned and pious Jew as Philo left out in the
cold?</p>
<p>Apologists do not explain at all convincingly why the Almighty could
not, or preferred not to, make Himself understood. If He could say
&ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; He could also have said &ldquo;Let
there be knowledge.&rdquo; Besides, after all, what is there in the
broad facts of modern science which could not be explained to an
intelligent savage to-day? The shape and movements of the earth are
explained in the most elementary geography books, and the theory of
Evolution can be made quite clear to comparative children (I speak from
personal experience). Recent discoveries have revealed to us that
ancient nations must have reached an extraordinarily high state of
civilisation. Six thousand years ago, in the valley of the Nile, there
existed a standard of civilisation incomparably higher than that of the
Jews at the time when God is alleged to have selected them as His
chosen people. &ldquo;The Old Testament,&rdquo; says Canon C. H.
Robinson, &ldquo;is the history of a people insignificant in number,
occupying a country about the same size as the county of Yorkshire;
remarkable neither for their superior learning, civilisation, nor
military power; remarkable, if for anything, for their obstinate,
grasping, usurious character; who, nevertheless, were chosen out of all
the nations of the ancient world to be the recipients of peculiar
blessings and favours.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3081src" href=
"#xd21e3081" name="xd21e3081src">38</a> This incomprehensible selection
of ignorant Jews to be the special recipients of Revelation only
emphasises <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>the contention that we have no right to assume
that learned men of two thousand years ago could not have understood
plain facts, or that it was necessary for them to believe in purely
imaginary explanations of the cosmos, in a flat, stationary earth, in a
blue-basin sky, in an &ldquo;Adam and Eve&rdquo; origin, in
devil-possession, in absurd miracles, etc. Their ignorance, which was
natural enough considering their opportunities, could easily have been
dispelled when God graciously condescended to come and live among them.
What a proof would that not have been of His Divinity!</p>
<p>In any case, we are to understand that the Apostles were inspired by
the Holy Ghost, so that they might be able to work miracles and be
witnesses unto Christ, even to the utmost parts of the earth. Surely,
then, they could and should have been enlightened for their mission
work up to the level, say, of some of our twentieth-century
theologians? The miracle of an intelligence and knowledge equal to that
of the average modern apologist is not, after all, so very
inconceivable, and it would, at least, have been more useful than
miracle-working in a miracle-believing age. Christians, who glibly
admit that Jesus had only the knowledge of His age, cannot, I think,
fully realise the force of such an admission. One reason for this may
be that their own knowledge is not completely up to date. That Jesus
had no knowledge of nature&rsquo;s inviolable laws and shared many of
the gross superstitions prevalent around Him; that He accepted the
Scriptures as literally true, and not in the sense now attributed to
them by the Higher Critics; that He believed that He would come again
&ldquo;in the clouds of heaven with power and great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>might,<span class="corr" id="xd21e3093" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> and that the generation in which He
lived would not pass away till this had been fulfilled&mdash;of all
this they may be dimly conscious; but what remain still to be studied
by them are the startling disclosures of Comparative Mythology, and of
the now fully-established theory of Evolution, and their bearing upon
the Christian Faith. The matter is one of the utmost importance, as
will be seen by a perusal of the following chapters. <span class=

<h3 class="main">&sect; 1. <i>The New Theological Theory of a
Progressive Revelation.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The facts and truths established by Science are no
longer made the subject of attacks by Christian apologists in the
manner that they used to be; they are now considered by them to be the
unfolding, through God&rsquo;s Providence, of pieces of information
hitherto concealed from us. A scientific discovery (by men who are more
often than not Agnostics) simply means that God wills to reveal another
detail of His eternal methods. There must be, we are told, a frank
modification, or even the abandonment, of certain preconceived ideas
which, faulty as they were, had sufficed for man in an earlier stage of
his development, and had come to be regarded as integral parts of his
religious faith. This is the substance of the modern apologist&rsquo;s
argument which is intended to reconcile all outlying discrepancies
between our new knowledge and our old beliefs. The new explanation,
based upon the assumption that revelation is progressive, will come as
a surprise to the rank and file of Christendom, who have hitherto been
given to understand that the Bible contained the one, only, and
sufficient revelation of God to man. However, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>there is no alternative. If accepted, many grave
difficulties of faith are swept away. Nay, more; the reasonableness of
our faith is immensely strengthened, and the facts of science and
research become a valuable adjunct to the armour of the Christian
apologist. On the other hand, a refusal to accept spells disaster to
the Christian faith. The truth of progressive revelation is, therefore,
a matter of life or death for the Christian religion; and, of all
branches of modern research, it is Comparative Mythology which
absolutely demands the complete establishment of this theory. If true,
our belief is further verified by the startling discoveries of the
ethnologist; if untrue, it is irrevocably shattered. Accordingly, in
this chapter I am giving a prominent place to the discussion of this
theory.</p>
<p>I think I may safely say that there is no department of knowledge
about which so little is known by the ordinary man, and even, I regret
to say, by the majority of ecclesiastics, as Comparative Mythology. Yet
it is the study of this science perhaps more than of any other which is
causing well-informed men and women to lose faith in Christianity. Ask
Christian professors in our universities who are in touch with the
thought around them, and you will hear that their sceptical friends are
all telling them the same thing; they cannot get over anthropology, and
especially that branch of it which concerns itself with the traditions
and beliefs of primitive peoples. Recent ethnological research has
thrown an entirely new light upon old problems. The discoveries of
science, including the animal origin of man, may, by a stretch of
imagination and faith, be reconciled with belief; so also the
disclosures of the Higher Criticism; but the very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>origin of Christianity is exposed by the study
of Comparative Mythology. &ldquo;It is indeed a melancholy and in some
respects thankless task to strike at the foundations of beliefs in
which, as in a strong tower, the hopes and aspirations of humanity
through long ages have sought a refuge from the storm and stress of
life. Yet sooner or later it is inevitable that the battery of the
comparative method should breach these venerable walls, mantled over
with the ivy and mosses and wild flowers of a thousand tender and
sacred associations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3119src" href=
"#xd21e3119" name="xd21e3119src">1</a></p>
<p>Some years ago there were ecclesiastics who took a lively interest
in Comparative Mythology. Students of Pagan religions as well as
Christian missionaries were bent on discovering more striking and more
startling coincidences in order to use them in confirmation of their
favourite theory that some rays of a primeval revelation, or some
reflection of the Jewish religion, had reached the uttermost ends of
the world. Subsequently the study of comparative mythology seems to
have lost much of its charm. Why?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The theory that there was a primeval preternatural revelation
granted to the fathers of the human race, and that the grains of truth
which catch our eye when exploring the temples of heathen gods are the
scattered fragments of that sacred heirloom&mdash;the seeds that fell
by the wayside or upon stony places&mdash;would find but few supporters
at present; no more, in fact, than the theory that there was in the
beginning one complete and perfect primeval language, broken up in
later times into the numberless languages of the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The opinion,&rdquo; again, &ldquo;that the Pagan religions were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>mere corruptions of the religion of the Old
Testament, once supported by men of high authority and great learning,
is now as completely surrendered as the attempts to explain Greek and
Latin as corruptions of Hebrew.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3131src" href="#xd21e3131" name="xd21e3131src">2</a></p>
<p>It will be as well, in the first place, to see exactly what the
Church herself now says on the matter; how far she recognises that
gigantic strides have been made in a study formerly pursued in a manner
necessarily elementary by the Alexandrian schools; how far she concedes
the conclusions of the modern ethnologist; and how far she approves of
progressive revelation as the explanation for the whole enigma of the
parallels between ancient beliefs and our own. For this purpose I think
I cannot do better than quote from two striking articles on the subject
in the <i>Church Times</i>. They were contributed by the editor of
<i>The Treasury</i> magazine. &ldquo;The study,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;of folk-lore, of anthropology, of primitive myth and ritual, has
made enormous strides within the last quarter of a century, and the
fruits of that study are now forced, <i>for the first
time</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3148src" href="#xd21e3148" name=
"xd21e3148src">3</a> upon the attention of the general public.
Presented in outline, the situation is as follows: We have been
accustomed to consider Christianity apart from all other religions. We
have recognised, indeed, the historical preparation for it so far as
that is described in the pages of the Old Testament; but we have
thought of that preparation as conducted among a single people, and by
means of a unique revelation. <i>Of pagan religions we have known
practically nothing.</i> The mythology of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>Greeks and Romans, which some of us had to learn
at school, seemed to be a collection of pointless fairy tales. And as
regards other and more primitive races, both ancient and modern, the
statement that &lsquo;the heathen, in his blindness, bows down to wood
and stone&rsquo; comprised accurately the sum of our knowledge. That
there could be any but the vaguest likeness between them and our own
beliefs was unimaginable. Possibly there was a belief in the Fatherhood
of some supreme being, some vague conception of a future life; while
sacrificial rites, as we knew, were not peculiar to the Jews. But the
other doctrines of our Creed we regarded as exclusively our own. <i>The
ideas of a Triune God-head, of an Incarnate Saviour, of the Virgin
Birth, of the Second Advent, of the Sacraments, of the Communion of
Saints</i>&mdash;these seemed to be the distinctive possessions of
Christianity; these were marks clearly dividing it from any form of
paganism. So, at least, we imagined. [Had we not every reason thus to
imagine on the authority of Holy Scripture?] But it proves that <i>we
were completely mistaken</i>. <i>The modern study of primitive religion
shows that every one of these beliefs is, or has been, held in some
part or other of the pagan world quite independently of Christian
influence</i>, and that, while we are bound to speak of these beliefs
as, in a sense, distinctly Christian, <i>to term them exclusively
Christian is no longer possible</i>.... In these early mythologies we
can discern the longing for a personal God, capable of direct
communication with man, and for some sort of union between the divine
and human natures. Whence did these instincts themselves originate?
<i>The one tenable reply seems to be that they were
God-implanted</i>.... The Zoroastrian anticipates the advent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>of a &lsquo;Saviour&rsquo; (Saoshyas), who will
end the strife between good and evil, personified as Ormuzd and
Ahriman, by sweeping away evil from the earth. In the ancient Vedic and
Scandinavian religions, in the Old-World creeds of Egypt and Babylon,
in the legends of Mexico and Polynesia, is found, in a variety of
guises, the same fundamental idea. Always there is a sense of a
supremely righteous Power; of a world tainted with evil, and out of
harmony with the Power above it; of the coming of some Deliverer, who
will establish a kingdom of righteousness. Once more, in many
mythologies the idea of a Virgin Birth is associated with that of a
Divine Incarnation. Men felt instinctively that the entrance of a
Divine Being into the human race must take place in a miraculous way.
And thus the Spirit of God, working by means of what we may term the
instinctive feelings of mankind, prepared the human race throughout the
world for the coming of the Son of God, to be born of a pure Virgin, to
take our nature upon Him for evermore, and to redeem us from the power
of sin.... We find conceptions, such as that of the Hindu
<i>Trimurti</i>, which seem to remember the doctrine of the Trinity. In
the sacramental meals of totem-worship, when a sacred animal is killed,
and partaken of by the worshippers in order that its power may be
communicated to them [not to mention &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; <i>men</i>
killed with the same idea], there seems a dim anticipation of the
highest Christian rite. Baptism as a cleansing and symbolical ceremony
was known centuries before the Christian era.... These rites and
beliefs, obscured by superstition and insufficient to satisfy the
longing which brought them into existence, were designed to serve as
the schoolmasters who would lead <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>the heathen at length to
Christ&rdquo; (cf. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

24</a>).</p>
<p>These remarks, by a clergyman of the Church of England, will enable
the ordinary person, who for the most part knows nothing whatever about
these things, to realise the immense importance of the questions raised
by Comparative Mythology.</p>

Remarks Upon Them.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before proceeding any further, it will be advisable to
consider some concrete examples of the parallels between the beliefs
and teachings of ancient religions and those of the Christian
religion.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch4.2.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">KRISHNA AND BUDDHA.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Krishna.</i>&mdash;Krishna was a miraculous
incarnation of Vishnu in the womb of Devaki. A chorus of angels
exclaimed: &ldquo;In the delivery of this favoured woman nature shall
have cause to exult.&rdquo; The birth was indicated in the heavens by a
star. On the morning of his birth the spirits of heaven danced and
sang, and the clouds emitted low, pleasing sounds. Though royally
descended, he was actually born in a cave.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3202src" href="#xd21e3202" name="xd21e3202src">4</a> The divine
child was recognised and adored by cowherds. He was presented with
gifts of sandalwood and perfumes. The holy Indian prophet, Nared, paid
him a visit, consulted the stars and declared him to be of celestial
descent. His birth was beset by peril, and his foster father was warned
by a heavenly voice to fly with the child, as the reigning monarch,
King Kansa, might take his life. The king ordered the massacre in all
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>States of all the male children born during the
night of the birth of Krishna. One of the first miracles performed by
Krishna, when mature, was the curing of a leper. A lame woman came with
a vessel filled with spices and sweet oil, and anointed his head.
Krishna was slain. At his death a black circle surrounded the moon, and
the sun was darkened at noonday. Spirits were to be seen on all sides.
Krishna descended into hell, rose again from the dead, and ascended
bodily into heaven, many persons witnessing his ascent. He is to come
again on earth in the latter days. He will appear as an armed warrior
riding a white horse. At his approach the sun and moon will be
darkened, the earth will tremble, and the stars fall from the firmament
(compare <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%206:2">Rev. vi. 2</a>,
<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%206:12-13">12,
13</a>). He is to judge the dead at the last day. Krishna is the
Creator of all things visible and invisible, and is the beginning,
middle, and end of all things. Krishna was transfigured before his
beloved disciple, Arjuna. Krishna was the meekest of beings. He
preached sublimely. According to the purer Vaishnava faith, he was pure
and chaste in reality; any amorousness related of him is to be
explained allegorically, as symbolising the longing of the human soul
for the Supreme; just as the amorous &ldquo;Song of Solomon&rdquo; is
said to be allegorical, and to mean &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s love for his
Church.&rdquo; Krishna even condescended to wash the feet of the
Brahmins. He is the incarnation of Vishnu, the second person in the
Hindoo Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva; and Vishnu in his
incarnations is a saviour, protector, and friend. Krishna said:
&ldquo;Let a man, if seeking God by deep abstraction, abandon his
possessions and his hopes, betake himself to some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>secluded spot, and fix his heart and thoughts on
God alone.&rdquo; And, again: &ldquo;Then be not sorrowful; from all
thy sins I will deliver thee.&rdquo; Many other such remarkable
passages might be adduced from the Bhagavad-gita. Justice, humanity,
good faith, compassion, disinterestedness&mdash;in fact, all the
virtues&mdash;are said to have been taught by Krishna, both by precept
and example; but we must remember, as Monier Williams informs us in his
<i>Hinduism</i>, that Krishna, in the ancient epic poems, is simply a
great hero, and it is not until about the fourth century <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> that he is deified and declared to be an incarnation
of Vishnu. In conclusion, the accounts of Krishna&rsquo;s childhood
agree very closely with the apocryphal accounts of Christ&rsquo;s
childhood.</p>
<p><i>Buddha.</i>&mdash;If the similarity between the histories of
Krishna and Jesus is remarkable, what shall we say of that between the
mythological<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3226src" href="#xd21e3226"
name="xd21e3226src">5</a> portions of the history of Gautama Buddha and
the history of Jesus? Looked upon as a confirmation of Progressive
Revelation, it is nothing short of marvellous, whether we regard the
similarity in events, characters, actions, or sayings. From
Buddha&rsquo;s divine incarnation until his ascension into the
celestial regions, almost every important episode of the life of Christ
appears to be paralleled. Attendant miraculous events, spotless
character, wonderful doings, cherished sayings&mdash;all are here.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>Buddha was miraculously<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3235src" href=
"#xd21e3235" name="xd21e3235src">6</a> born of the pure and holy Maya.
He descended into her womb from heaven in a spiritual manner. There was
joy in heaven, the Devas singing: &ldquo;To-day Bodhisatwa is born on
earth, to give joy and peace to men and Devas.&rdquo; He was recognised
by the aged and devout Asita as the perfect Buddha come to the world
for its salvation. His life was threatened by the King Bimbisara, who
was advised to destroy the child. He was presented in the temple. When
still a mere child he was found to be as proficient as his masters, and
he disputed with learned doctors. His ancestry was traced from his
father to Maha Sammata, the first monarch of the world. He bathed in
water, the spirits making their presence known as he did so. When about
to adopt a religious life, he fasted for a long time, and was tempted
by Mara, the author of Evil; but he heeded not the words of the Evil
One, and bade him depart from him. The heavens showed their
appreciation of this defeat by raining flowers. Towards the end of his
life he was transfigured when on a mountain in India called Pandava. He
performed great miracles. For instance, on one occasion he floated
through the air across a river; and, on another, he caused a tempest to
cease, and so saved a disciple, who was in imminent danger of
shipwreck. Shortly before his death a weeping woman embraced his feet.
When Buddha died many miracles occurred. The coffin was opened, and the
body uncovered, supernaturally. He promised that another Buddha would
be sent to them. He foretold his departure, and after death entered
Nirvana. He was very early regarded as omniscient and absolutely
sinless. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>Earth and heaven did homage to him at birth and
death. A great earthquake occurred at his Temptation. He is represented
as saying: &ldquo;Let all the sins that are committed in the world fall
upon me, that the world may be delivered&rdquo;; and again: &ldquo;Hide
your good deeds, and confess before the world the sins you have
committed&rdquo;; and again: &ldquo;Though the great world be swallowed
up and pass away, yet be assured the words of Buddha are true&rdquo;;
and again: &ldquo;Beware of fixing your eyes upon women&rdquo;;
&ldquo;A wise man should avoid unchaste life, as if it were a burning
pit of live coals&rdquo;; &ldquo;One who is not able to live in a state
of celibacy should not commit adultery.&rdquo; According to Buddha, the
motives of all our actions should be pity, or love for our neighbour.
Those who became his disciples were told they must renounce the world,
give up their riches, and take the vow of poverty. Finally, we should
note that Buddha aimed to establish a &ldquo;Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;
(Dharmachakra); that the account given by St. Peter (Ep. ii., ch. 3) of
the earth once destroyed by water, and about to be destroyed by fire,
is in agreement with the Buddhist story; and that the Jews believed in
the pre-existence of souls and a modified form of metempsychosis
(transmigration of the soul).</p>
<p>It is difficult to separate fiction from fact; but the generally
accepted records show that, together with superior natural endowments,
Gautama Buddha attained to an exceptional purity of life and integrity
of purpose. Probably he never arrogated to himself any higher authority
than that of a teacher; but his followers, turning for consolation to
the theory that he still lived, exalted him, within a quarter of a
century of his death, to a place among their deities. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>As
already mentioned, he was very early regarded as omniscient and
absolutely sinless.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3244src" href=
"#xd21e3244" name="xd21e3244src">7</a> All sorts of legends, borrowed
from current myths, attach themselves to the story of his life, while
his teaching as a simple-hearted, truth-seeking philanthropist became
encrusted with the superstitions and religious speculations that were
current. As with Krishna, so here there are stories of Buddha&rsquo;s
childhood of which the apocryphal stories of Christ&rsquo;s childhood
are an almost exact reproduction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch4.2.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">PARALLELS OTHER THAN KRISHNA AND BUDDHA.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the case of Krishna and Buddha it is contended by
some Christian writers that the stories must have been borrowed from
Christian sources both canonical and apocryphal. This contention,
founded on the lateness of the mythical stories in literary form, will
be considered in due course; but first let us have clearly before our
minds those parallels concerning which there is no such contention, for
the simple reason that there is no getting away from the fact that the
beliefs existed long before the advent of Christ. In ancient religions
other than Hindooism and Buddhism, there are, among many others,
distinct parallels to&mdash;the Virgin Birth; the Heavenly Choir; the
Epiphany; the Slaughter of the Innocents; the Temptation and Forty
Days&rsquo; Fast; the Miracles; the Crucifixion Darkness, and Descent
into Hell; the Resurrection and Ascension; the Second Coming and Day of
Judgment.</p>
<p><i>The Virgin Birth.</i>&mdash;According to Chinese legends, the
sages Fohi (? 3468 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>) and Lao-Kiun (about
600 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>were born of virgins. Dean
Milman mentions in his <i>History of Christianity</i> that the first
Jesuit missionaries who went to China were appalled at finding in the
mythology of that country a counterpart of the story of the Virgin. In
Persia, Zoroaster,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3267src" href=
"#xd21e3267" name="xd21e3267src">8</a> the founder of the Perso-Iranian
national religion, was miraculously conceived. All attempts to connect
him with Hebrew influences are groundless. In Egypt, Horus, who had the
epithet of Saviour, was born of the virgin Isis. The Egyptian Bible,
remember, is the oldest in the world! Plutarch mentions the notion of
the Egyptians that a woman might conceive by the approach of some
divine spirit. Egyptian monuments represent the infant saviour in the
arms of his virgin mother, or sitting on her knee. The image of the
child was worshipped just as the Bambino is worshipped in Rome to-day.
Women then, as now, believed in its efficacy for their relief in time
of nature&rsquo;s sorrows. In Grecian and Roman mythology the
&ldquo;Sons of Jove&rdquo;&mdash;Hercules, Bacchus, Amphion, Perseus,
Mercury, &AElig;olus, Apollo, and others&mdash;have mortal mothers.
Speaking of this, the Christian Father, Justin Martyr, declared that
the myths regarding the multitude of sons of gods, and especially the
myth regarding the virgin&rsquo;s son Perseus, had been invented by the
demons in order to rob the manifestation of Jesus, the true Son of God,
of its importance. He also insisted that, with their doctrine of the
Virgin-birth of Jesus, of His passion, and of His ascension, the
Christians were affirming nothing new <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>as compared with what
was alleged of the so-called sons of Zeus.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3275src" href="#xd21e3275" name="xd21e3275src">9</a> Even
regarding Plato there was a legend that his mother, Perictione, had
experienced a miraculous conception through the influences of the God
Apollo, and that the God had declared to Aris, to whom she was
betrothed, the parentage of the child (compare St. <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%201:20">Matthew i.
20</a>). This was believed in by the disciples of Plato centuries
before the Christian era. Among northern nations the sons of Odin take
the place of the sons of Jove. Thus &ldquo;Baldur the Good,&rdquo; the
Beneficent Saviour, was the son of Odin and Friga. The worship of Friga
was continued until that of the Virgin Mary took its place. In Mexico,
the &ldquo;Saviour&rdquo; Quetzalcoatl was born of a pure virgin, who
was called the &ldquo;Queen of Heaven.&rdquo; An ambassador from heaven
announced to the virgin Sochiquetzal, mother of Quetzalcoatl, that it
was the will of God that she should conceive a son without connection
with man. Here we have an exact parallel to the annunciation of the
Virgin Mary (St. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:26-35">Luke i.
26&ndash;35</a>), in a part of the globe that was not discovered by
Christians till nearly 1,500 years after the birth of Christ! Similar
traditions of Saviours are found among various tribes of North and
South America.</p>
<p>Regarding the tendency to believe in incarnations, Dr.
Illingworth<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3289src" href="#xd21e3289" name=
"xd21e3289src">10</a> explains that &ldquo;a general tendency in the
human mind to expect a thing cannot possibly be twisted into a
presumption against its occurrence.... The fact of the expectation does
not logically make invention a likelier alternative than occurrence,
except upon one hypothesis&mdash;namely, that the occurrence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>is impossible.&rdquo; This argument skims
over&mdash;or, I might almost say, neglects&mdash;the real contention
of the Rationalist. Let us assume that incarnation is not ruled out of
court as being <i>&agrave; priori</i> impossible; the virgin-birth of
Jesus was subsequently invented by the Christian Church because its
eminent suitability necessitated its invention. Only thus could the
divinity and sinlessness of Jesus Christ be firmly established. More
especially would this be the case in an age when everyone was familiar
with the notion of virgin-born Saviours. The minds of men were deeply
imbued with the idea of miraculous birth in the case of anyone claiming
to be of divine origin. Only on this understanding would the heathen,
already believing in their own virgin-born Saviours, have accepted
Christianity.</p>
<p><i>The Heavenly Choir.</i>&mdash;Even Confucius, the celebrated
philosopher (born 551 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>), was ushered into
the world with dragons and angels hovering about the couch, and with
the sound of heavenly music in the air. At the birth of Osiris, the
father of Horus, another Egyptian &ldquo;Saviour,&rdquo; a voice was
heard proclaiming that the &ldquo;Ruler of all the earth is
born.&rdquo; There was joy in Olympus when Apollo was born, and at the
time of the birth of Hercules his father Zeus spake from heaven, and
said: &ldquo;This day shall a child be born of the race of Perseus, who
shall be the mightiest of the sons of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Epiphany.</i>&mdash;Legends of the coming of wise men to see
an infant grew up in various places. Krishna was visited by sages who
brought perfumes. Confucius has a somewhat similar legend, and one
occurs even in connection with the birth of Plato.</p>
<p><i>The Slaughter of the Innocents.</i>&mdash;The story of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>&ldquo;dangerous child&rdquo; is almost
universal. Horus, Zoroaster, and Bacchus, for example, were
&ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; children.</p>
<p><i>The Forty Days&rsquo; Fast and the
Temptation.</i>&mdash;According to Pliny, Zoroaster lived for thirty
years in the wilderness upon cheese. The Devil made Zoroaster
magnificent promises; but the temptations were in vain. The ancient
Persians had a religious festival, which they annually celebrated,
called the &ldquo;Salutation of Mithras (the sun-god),&rdquo; and
during it <i>forty days</i> were set apart for sacrifice and
thanksgiving. Among the ancient Egyptians the priest submitted to
abstinence of the most severe description. &ldquo;The priests in
Heliopolis,&rdquo; says Plutarch, &ldquo;have many fasts, during which
they meditate upon divine things.&rdquo; Fasting and self-denial were
observances required of the Greeks who desired initiation into the
mysteries. The same practice was found among the ancient Mexicans and
Peruvians. The Mexicans had a <i>forty days&rsquo;</i> fast, in memory
of Quetzalcoatl, who was tempted and fasted <i>forty days</i> on a
mountain. Lord Kingsborough says: &ldquo;The temptation of Quetzalcoatl
and the fast of forty days ... are very curious and
mysterious.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3330src" href=
"#xd21e3330" name="xd21e3330src">11</a> Mr. Bonwick says: &ldquo;The
Spaniards were surprised to see the Mexicans keep the vernal forty
days&rsquo; fast.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3335src" href=
"#xd21e3335" name="xd21e3335src">12</a></p>
<p>Turning to the Old Testament, we may remind ourselves that Moses
went up into a mountain to receive certain instructions from God, and
&ldquo;was there with the Lord <i>forty days and forty nights</i>, and
he did neither eat bread nor drink water.&rdquo; On a second occasion,
when he received the Ten Commandments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>he was again with the
Lord <i>forty days and forty nights</i>, and did neither eat bread nor
drink water. Elijah fled to the desert, where an angel gave him cake
and water, and in the strength of that meat he went for <i>forty
days</i> without food. The number &ldquo;forty&rdquo; occurs over and
over again in that portion of the Old Testament which the Higher
Criticism has shown to be unhistorical. The Rationalist avers that the
number &ldquo;forty&rdquo; is mythological, and that we have this story
of the Forty Days&rsquo; Fast and the Temptation in the New Testament
because the writer wishes to show that Jesus Christ was proof against
all temptation; that He, too, as well as other Christs, could resist
the powers of the Prince of Evil. It may be urged that in all these
cases the number is quite immaterial. Are we not, then, to take the
author of &ldquo;The Acts&rdquo; literally when he informs us that
Christ spent <i>forty days</i> on earth after His resurrection?</p>
<p><i>The Miracles.</i>&mdash;Not only Krishna and Buddha, but all
leaders of religious movements, had the reputation of having performed
miracles. Religions were established as much by the miracles as by the
preachings. Miracles were needed in those days on all special
occasions. Many of them are attested in the gravest manner by the
gravest writers, and were firmly believed at the time by the people.
Healing miracles, such as those performed by Jesus, were the commonest
of all. The Gospel miracles are in no respect singular or more
wonderful. Horus, as well as Krishna, <i>raised the dead to life</i>.
Bacchus <i>changed water into wine</i>. &AElig;sculapius not only cured
the sick, but <i>raised the dead</i>. Pausanias, the eminent Greek
geographer and historian, writes that in the temple of &AElig;sculapius
at Epidaurus there was an old pillar dedicated to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>memory of Hippolytus, who had been <i>raised
from the dead</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3375src" href=
"#xd21e3375" name="xd21e3375src">13</a> Apollonius of Tyana was
celebrated for the wonderful miracles he performed. He caused a devil
to depart out of a youth, and he <i>restored a dead maiden to life</i>.
The Christian Fathers inform us that Simon Magus, with the
Devil&rsquo;s aid, could make his appearance wherever he pleased at any
moment; could poise himself in the air; produce trees from the earth
suddenly [the mango tree trick?]; fling himself from high precipices
unhurt [the very feat suggested by the Devil in the Temptation]; and
walk through the streets accompanied by spirits of the dead. Tacitus,
the celebrated Roman historian, tells us that the Emperor Vespasian
(born 9 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>) performed wonderful miracles for
the good of mankind, and among others he describes the <i>cure of a
blind man with the emperor&rsquo;s spittle</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Atonement.</i>&mdash;In China the Holy One (Tien) dies to
save the world. &ldquo;The sufferings and death of Osiris were the
great mystery of the Egyptian religion. His being the divine goodness,
and the abstract idea of &lsquo;good,&rsquo; his manifestation upon
earth (like an Indian god), his death and resurrection, and his office
as judge of the dead in a future life, look like the early revelation
of a future manifestation of the deity converted into a mythological
fable.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3394src" href="#xd21e3394"
name="xd21e3394src">14</a> While Osiris is the judge, Horus, his son,
is the mediator. In the Judgment scene in the Book of the Dead, Horus,
the son of Isis, leads the deceased, after his heart has been weighed,
into the presence of Osiris (see Papyrus of Ani, plates 3 &amp; 4).
Mithras, the sun-god of the Persians, was a &ldquo;Mediator&rdquo;
between God and men&mdash;the &ldquo;Saviour,&rdquo; who, by his
laborious conflicts, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>worked their salvation. He was also called
the &ldquo;Word.&rdquo; Attys, called the &ldquo;Only Begotten
Son&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Saviour,&rdquo; was worshipped by the
Phrygians, and represented by them as a man tied or nailed to a tree.
Adonis was another virgin-born &ldquo;Saviour&rdquo; who suffered for
mankind. The yearly festival of Adonis in the spring was a special
favourite with women. In the Old Testament reference is made to the
weeping of the women over Tammuz, the Babylonian equivalent of Adonis
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ez%208:14">Ezekiel
viii. 14</a>). According to the Rev. Sir G. W. Cox,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3405src" href="#xd21e3405" name="xd21e3405src">15</a> he was
the crucified Tao (divine love personified). The Rev. Dr. Parkhurst, in
the chapter on the Resurrection in his Hebrew lexicon, says: &ldquo;I
find myself obliged to refer Tammuz to that class of idols which were
originally designed to represent the promised Saviour, the desire of
all nations.&rdquo; Prometheus was a Saviour who suffered the most
fearful tortures as the friend of the human race.
&AElig;schylus&rsquo;s tragedy, <i>Prometheus Vinctus</i>, was acted in
Athens <i>five hundred years before the Christian era</i>. Even
Bacchus, whom most of us think of as the rollicking wine-god of
classical mythology, was a slain Saviour.</p>
<p>When we turn to the New World we find the worship of a crucified
Saviour among the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians. Lord Kingsborough
tells us that, according to the belief of the ancient Mexicans,
&ldquo;the death of Quetzalcoatl <i>upon the cross</i>&rdquo; was
&ldquo;an atonement for the sins of mankind.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3424src" href="#xd21e3424" name="xd21e3424src">16</a> Dr.
Daniel Brinton relates how the Aztecs had a feast which they celebrated
<i>in the early spring</i>, when &ldquo;victims were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>nailed to a cross and shot with an
arrow.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3434src" href="#xd21e3434"
name="xd21e3434src">17</a> Alexander von Humboldt, in his <i>American
Researches</i>, also speaks of a feast, at which the Mexicans
<i>crucified</i> a man and <i>pierced</i> him with an arrow. The Rev.
J. P. Lundy, speaking of this, says: &ldquo;Here is the old story of
Prometheus crucified on the Caucasus, and of all other pagan
crucifixions of the young incarnate divinities of India, Persia, Asia
Minor, and Egypt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3449src" href=
"#xd21e3449" name="xd21e3449src">18</a></p>
<p><i>Moral Teaching.</i>&mdash;There is not only an extraordinary
similarity in beliefs, but also in moral teachings. The teachings of
Confucius, Mencius, and Wang Yang Ming might, as Professor Nitobe
points out,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3459src" href="#xd21e3459" name=
"xd21e3459src">19</a> just as well be considered plagiarisms from the
Divine library, for they furnish numerous remarkable parallels to the
New Testament teaching. Taoism, the philosophy of Laotze, for a long
time successfully rivalled the more utilitarian system of Confucius,
and its close agreement with many of the teachings of Christ is most
noticeable. The morals of the ancient Egyptians are clearly set forth
in the Book of the Dead, which came into use after 2000 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> They indicate a far higher standard than existed in
Israel in David&rsquo;s time. &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; as Dr. Callaway
remarks,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3468src" href="#xd21e3468" name=
"xd21e3468src">20</a> &ldquo;in traditions which still linger among us,
the law under which David lived and reigned was perfect and divine;
while the name of Egypt stands for darkness and sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the parallels in the moral teaching, Dean Farrar, in
his work, <i>Seekers after God</i>, has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>clearly shown that
&ldquo;to say that pagan morality kindled its faded taper at the Gospel
light, whether furtively or unconsciously, that it dissembled the
obligation and made a boast of the splendour, as if it were originally
her own, is to make an assertion wholly untenable.&rdquo; He points out
that the attempts of the Christian Fathers to make out Pythagoras a
debtor to Hebraic wisdom, Plato an &ldquo;Atticising Moses,&rdquo;
Aristotle a learner of ethics from a Jew, Seneca a correspondent of St.
Paul, were due &ldquo;in some cases to ignorance, in some to a want of
perfect honesty in controversial dealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Apocryphal Gospels.</i>&mdash;We are assured by Christian writers
that the parallels between the accounts of Krishna&rsquo;s and
Buddha&rsquo;s childhood and those in the apocryphal gospels of
Christ&rsquo;s childhood are due to the Hindoos having borrowed legends
current among the early Christians. Dr. Wallis Budge, the keeper of
Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities in the British Museum, informs us,
however, that &ldquo;several of the incidents of the wanderings of the
Virgin with the child in Egypt, as recorded in the Apocryphal Gospels,
reflect scenes in the life of Isis as described in the texts found on
the Metternich Stele.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3485src" href=
"#xd21e3485" name="xd21e3485src">21</a> And, again, he says: &ldquo;In
the apocryphal literature of the first six centuries which followed the
evangelisation of Egypt, several of the legends about Isis and her
sorrowful wanderings were made to centre round the mother of
Christ.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3490src" href="#xd21e3490"
name="xd21e3490src">22</a> The evidence is conclusive that certain
legends prevalent among the early Christians were borrowed from the
ancient Egyptian religion; yet we are to believe that where the Krishna
and Buddha <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>parallels are concerned the borrowing process
was the other way! So be it. Let us suppose that certain Egyptian
superstitions reached the Hindoo through the medium of the Christian;
the fact remains that beliefs once held by devout but unlettered
Christians have a heathen origin. This is of serious import, for it
lends weight to the suspicion that the marvellous tales in the
canonical gospels have been similarly derived from heathen
legends&mdash;legends from which some of the more glaring absurdities
and all that would mar the ethical ideals of the Christian religion
were eclectically expunged.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">ARE THE KRISHNA AND BUDDHA LEGENDS BORROWED FROM
CHRISTIANITY?</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have indicated a few of the more striking parallels
in other religions besides Krishnaism and Buddhism. Did space permit,
it could be shown that there are also parallels to the teaching of
Christ, the darkness at the Crucifixion, the descent into Hell, the
Resurrection, the claim of Jesus Christ to be &ldquo;Alpha and
Omega&rdquo; (according to the Revelation of St. John), the prophecy of
the Second Coming, the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the
doctrine of the Trinity, the worship of the Blessed Virgin, the
Christian symbols (cross, triangle, I.H.S., fish, serpent, dove, and
lamb). I cannot understand what the Christian cause can gain by
ascribing the parallels in Hindoo mythology to Christian sources, when
there is all this mass of evidence for parallels that are quite as
extraordinary (though less numerous) in those ancient religions where
the priority to Christianity cannot reasonably be denied. Certainly the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>Krishna and Buddha parallels are extremely
numerous and strikingly exact; but a policy which seeks to explain them
in a different manner from that adopted in the case of the same
phenomena in other religions, while it serves to confirm the suspicions
of the sceptic, is doomed eventually to failure. This being so, it is
unnecessary, I think, to enter at any great length into the
controversy.</p>
<p>In Mr. J. M. Robertson&rsquo;s book, <i>Christianity and
Mythology</i>, there is a scholarly investigation from which I extract
the following leading points<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3509src" href=
"#xd21e3509" name="xd21e3509src">23</a>:&mdash;Hindoos, as Professor
Tiele urges, could perfectly well have borrowed, if they did borrow,
from Egypt before Christianity was heard of. There is hardly a leading
detail in the Krishna birth legend which is not variously paralleled in
other early non-Christian mythology. The more we collate the main
Christian myth-notions with those of Krishnaism, the more clearly does
it appear that, instead of the latter being borrowed from the former,
they are, not indeed the originals from which Christianity borrowed,
but always presumptively the more ancient, and in one or two cases they
do appear to be the actual sources of Gospel stories. The lateness of
the Pur&acirc;nic stories in literary form is no argument against their
antiquity. Scholars are agreed that late documents often preserve
extremely old myth-material. The leading elements in the Krishna myth
are inexplicable save on the view that the cultus is ancient. The close
coincidences in the legends of Krishna and Buddha are to be explained
in terms of borrowing by the latter from the former, and not <i>vice
versa</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>I should add here that the denial of the
&ldquo;Christian accretions&rdquo; theory does not convey also the
implication that the Bible story was borrowed from the Krishna and
Buddha myths. On the contrary, the strong probability is that there has
been little or no borrowing either way&mdash;that there is a common
source for both in earlier Aryan and Semitic myths.</p>
<p>In the Introduction to his standard work, <i>The Romantic History of
Buddha</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3522src" href="#xd21e3522" name=
"xd21e3522src">24</a> Mr. Beal refers to the legends concerning the
pre-existence of Buddha in heaven&mdash;his miraculous
incarnation&mdash;salutation by angels&mdash;recognition by Asita
(Simeon)&mdash;presentation in the Temple&mdash;baptism by fire and
water&mdash;disputation with doctors&mdash;temptation in the
wilderness&mdash;life passed in preaching and working miracles,
etc.&mdash;and frankly admits that, &ldquo;if we could prove that they
were unknown in the East for some centuries after Christ, the
explanation would be easy; but all the evidence we have goes to prove
the contrary.&rdquo; Regarding the parallelisms with the Apocryphal
Gospels, he says: &ldquo;It would be a natural inference that many of
the events in the legend of Buddha were borrowed from the Apocryphal
Gospels (compare, for example, the <i>Gospel of the Infancy</i>, chap.
xx.: &lsquo;Our Lord learning his alphabet,&rsquo; with the account
given in chap. xi. of this volume), if we were quite certain that these
Apocryphal Gospels had not borrowed from it.&rdquo; In his later work,
<i>Buddhist Literature</i>, Mr. Beal modifies his position.</p>
<p>Neither Max M&uuml;ller in his <i>Introduction to the Science of
Religion</i>, nor Forlong in his <i>Short Studies of the Science of
Comparative Religions</i>, nor Senart in his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>learned work, <i lang="fr">La L&eacute;gende du
Buddha</i>, nor Seydel in his <i lang="de">Evangelium von Jesu</i> and
his <i>Buddha Legends</i>, nor Pfleiderer in his <i lang=
"de">Urchristentum</i>, supports the theory of Christian accretions.
Bunsen, in his <i>Angel-Messiah</i>, maintains (p. 18) &ldquo;that,
according to Sanscrit and Chinese scriptures and the stone-cut edicts
of Asoka and the Senchi Tope, certain legends about Buddha circulated
in India and China, not only before the apostolic age, but more than
three centuries earlier,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;among these legends the
most ancient are those which refer to the incarnation of Buddha as the
Angel Messiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On page 10 of Rhys Davids&rsquo; well-known little work,
<i>Buddhism</i> (published under the direction of the S.P.C.K.), we
read: &ldquo;There is every reason to believe that the Pitakas now
extant in Ceylon are substantially identical with the books of the
Orthodox Canon, as settled at the Council of Patna about the year 250
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> As no works would have been received into
the canon which were not then believed to be very old, the Pitakas may
be approximately placed in the fourth century <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>, and parts of them possibly read back very nearly, if
not quite, to the time of Gautama himself.&rdquo; On page 15 it is
explained that, when the statements in the Sanscrit and Pali texts
agree, the greatest reliance may be placed upon them, &ldquo;not indeed
as to the actual facts of Gautama&rsquo;s life, but as to the belief of
the early Buddhists concerning it.&rdquo; Professor Rhys Davids
enumerates the more important of these early beliefs, and they include
many of the startling coincidences which I have noticed. The later
beliefs he passes over for the most part in silence; but, speaking
generally, he is of opinion that the greater portion, if not all, of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>legends could be explained by hero-worship, mere
poetical imagery, misapprehension, the desire to edify, applications to
Gautama of previously existing stories or sun-myths, and so on. Nowhere
does he state or imply that in any of the legends, early <i>or
late</i>, there can be any application to Gautama of the Gospel stories
of the life of Christ; while he considers M. Senart&rsquo;s theory of
the almost complete dependence of the Buddha legends on solar myths
&ldquo;most interesting.&rdquo; Now, it is just those very ideas of
virgin-birth, resurrection, and ascension appearing in the later
legends which were nothing more nor less than solar myths. In any case,
whatever their origin, they were world-wide very many centuries before
the Christian era; so any argument from the lateness of these legends
is founded upon sand. In his <i>Buddhism</i>, as also in his article on
Buddhism in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, the Professor
steers clear of the question of the parallels; but in his <i>Buddhist
Suttas</i>, translated by him from the Pali and appearing in the
&ldquo;Sacred Books of the East&rdquo; series, we read (in the
Introduction, p. 165) that while he &ldquo;ventures to disagree with
writers who argue that the resemblances in the Pali Pitakas and
passages in the New Testament indicate that the New Testament as the
later must be borrowed,&rdquo; he holds that the resemblance is due
<i>not to any borrowing on the one side or the other</i>, but
&ldquo;solely to the similarity of the conditions under which the two
movements grew&rdquo; [and, the Rationalist would add, a similarity in
the myths afloat is a part, and a very essential part, of the
similarity of the conditions].</p>
<p>So also with regard to the lateness of the Krishna legends in
literary form, it is futile to argue that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>are,
to use a familiar term, cribbed from the canonical and apocryphal
gospels, when most of them are obviously plagiarisms of the ancient
sun-myths. The Rev. Sir G. W. Cox, speaking on this subject in his
<i>Aryan Mythology</i>, says: &ldquo;There is no more room for
inferring foreign influence in the growth of any of these myths than,
as Bunsen rightly insists, there is room for tracing Christian
influence in the early epical literature of the Teutonic tribes.
Practically the myths of Krishna seem to have been fully developed in
the days of Megasthenes (fourth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>),
who identifies him with the Greek Hercules.&rdquo; [Megasthenes wrote a
work on India, which was the chief source of the later Greek
information on the subject.] Professor Monier Williams, the accepted
authority on Hinduism, writing for the S.P.G., in his book, <i>Indian
Wisdom</i>, and speaking of the <i>Bhagavad-gita</i>, says: &ldquo;It
may reasonably be questioned whether there could have been any actual
contact of the Hindoo system with Christianity without a more
satisfactory result in the modification of Pantheistic and
anti-Christian ideas.&rdquo; Again, he says: &ldquo;The religious
creeds, rites, customs, and habits of thought of the Hindoos generally
had altered little since the days of Menu, 500 years <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>&rdquo; In his <i>Hinduism</i> (p. 19) he shows that
&ldquo;we may be justified in assuming that the hymns of the Veda were
probably composed by a succession of poets at different dates between
1500 and 1000 years <span class="sc">B.C.</span>&rdquo; This is an
important concession, because the ancient hymns of the Veda furnish the
germs of those sun-myths which tell of the death, resurrection, and
ascension of a virgin-born saviour.</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of the conclusions of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>highest authorities regarding Krishnaistic and
Buddhistic beliefs, I hope I may have so far carried the reader with me
that he will be prepared to admit that there are very many striking
resemblances to the Gospel stories in those ancient beliefs whose
priority to Christianity is not disputed. Now that these resemblances
are no longer attributed to a device of the Evil One, an explanation
for them is urgently required. The explanation from the Christian side
is the theory of a Progressive Revelation; and, apparently, there can
be no other, if Christianity be true. The reader has been put in
possession of a few details of the remarkable parallels, and he should
apply this theory for himself to each and all of them, and see whether
it furnishes a fair working hypothesis, whether his mind can accept the
explanation now offered to him, and, I might almost add, whether he can
honestly continue to call himself a Christian believer. Let him ask
himself which is the more probable, that in the common mythos we have
marvellous anticipations of the Bible stories, or that in the latter we
have reproductions of the former?</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I must ask the reader&rsquo;s patience if I postpone
my final remarks on Progressive Revelation until I have adduced some
illustrations of the beliefs and customs of primitive man, as here also
this same theory has to apply. Thus far the pagan beliefs have appeared
to be of a comparatively harmless character; but this can by no means
be said of the beliefs of savage man. He does not confine himself, like
his more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>civilised brother, to mystical beliefs in
Saviours who once upon a time suffered for him, and whose body and
blood are to be <i>symbolically</i> assimilated; but, being of a
realistic (or shall we say materialistic?) turn of mind, he prefers
(the inevitable result of a restricted intellectual
development)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3628src" href="#xd21e3628"
name="xd21e3628src">25</a> to satisfy his religious emotions with the
spectacle of a real human-divine sufferer, and by a sacrificial feast
of real flesh and blood. Can this be God&rsquo;s method of revealing
Himself? True, the religious convictions of civilised man have been a
fruitful source of human agony, both physical and mental, in many a
bloody fight and massacre, in cruel and relentless persecutions, in
every refinement of excruciating torture and pitiable distress to body
and mind; but it is possible to gloze over all this with various
specious arguments. It is not so easy to do so with examples drawn from
the history of savage races. The only thing is that so few have ever
had these examples brought before them, or, at least, have ever thought
of connecting them with anything that has to do with the truth of
Christianity. I shall, therefore, now give some illustrations of the
beliefs and customs of primitive man. A vivid description may succeed
in convincing the reader of the absurdity of the new theory, where mere
vague ideas of savage ritual would fail. &ldquo;Of the human sacrifices
of rude peoples, those of the Mexicans are perhaps the most
instructive, for in them the theanthropic character of the victim comes
out most clearly.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3634src" href=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Terrible was the prestige of the priesthood of
Mexico. The greater the State grew, the larger were the hecatombs of
human victims. Almost every god had to be propitiated in the same way;
but above all must the war-god be for ever glutted with the smoking
hearts of slain captives. Scarcely any historian, says Prescott,
estimates the number of human beings sacrificed yearly throughout the
Empire at less than 20,000, and some make it 50,000. The Franciscan
monks computed that 2,500 victims were annually sacrificed in the town
and district of Mexico alone. Of this doomed host, Huitzilopochtli had
the lion&rsquo;s share; and it is recorded that at the dedication of
his great new temple <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1486 [that is to say,
nearly 1,500 years after God was pleased to reveal Himself definitely
to mankind] there were slain in his honour 70,000 prisoners of war, who
had been reserved for the purpose for years throughout the Empire. They
formed a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>train two miles long, and the work of priestly
butchery went on for several days.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3664src" href="#xd21e3664" name="xd21e3664src">28</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;At every festival of the God there was a new hecatomb of
victims, and we may conceive how the chronic spectacle burnt itself in
on the imagination of the people.... And then the horror of the
sacrificial act! In the great majority of the sacrifices the victim was
laid living on the convex stone and held by the limbs, while the slayer
cut open his breast with the sacred flint (or rather obsidian)
knife&mdash;the ancient knife used before men had the use of metals,
and therefore most truly religious&mdash;and tore out the palpitating
heart, which was held on high to the all-seeing sun, before being set
to burn in incense in front of the idol, whose lips, and the walls of
whose shrines, were devoutly daubed with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In connection with one annual festival of Tezcatlipoca, the
Creator and &lsquo;soul of the world,&rsquo; who combined the
attributes of perpetual youthful beauty with the function of the God of
Justice and Retribution, as the Winter Sun, there was selected for
immolation a young male captive of especial beauty, who was treated
with great reverence for a whole year before being sacrificed.... When
all was over the priests piously improved the occasion, preaching that
all this had been typical of human destiny, while the aristocracy
sacramentally ate the victim&rsquo;s roasted limbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They [Christians] mystically eat the body of the slain God.
Now, this very act was performed by the Mexicans, not only literally as
we have seen, but in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>the symbolic way also; and they connected
their sacraments with the symbol of the <i>cross</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the Mexicans were no longer cannibals by taste is shown
by the fact that in the great siege by Cortez they died of starvation
by thousands. They never ate fellow citizens: only the sacrificially
slain captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strangest thing of all is that their frightful system of
sacrifice was bound up not only with a strict and ascetic sexual
morality, but with an emphatic humanitarian doctrine. If asceticism be
virtue, they cultivated virtue zealously. There was a Mexican Goddess
of Love, and there was of course plenty of vice; but nowhere could men
win a higher reputation for sanctity by living in celibacy. Their
saints were numerous. They had nearly all the formulas of Christian
morality, so-called. The priests themselves mostly lived in strict
celibacy; and they educated children with the greatest vigilance in
their temple schools and higher colleges. They taught the people to be
peaceful, to bear injuries with meekness, to rely on God&rsquo;s mercy
and not on their own merits; they taught, like Jesus and the Pagans,
that adultery could be committed by the eyes and the heart; and, above
all, they exhorted men to feed the poor. The public hospitals were
carefully attended to, at a time when some Christian countries had
none. They had the practice of confession and absolution, and in the
regular exhortation of the confessor there was this formula: Clothe the
naked and feed the hungry, whatever privations it may cost thee; for
remember their flesh is like thine, and they are men like thee; cherish
the sick, for they are the image of God. And in this very same
exhortation there was further urged <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>on the penitent the
special duty of instantly <i>procuring a slave for sacrifice to the
deity</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mexican believed in the resurrection of the Man-God. Dr. Frazer
relates how &ldquo;the idea that the God thus slain in the person of
his representative comes to life again immediately was graphically
represented in the Mexican ritual by skinning the slain man-god, and
clothing in his skin a living man, who thus became the new
representative of the god-head.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3692src" href="#xd21e3692" name="xd21e3692src">29</a></p>
<p>It is civilisation that determines the tone of religion. In Peru,
where the civilisation was higher and the priesthood less powerful, the
sacrificial system was less burdensome and less terrible. Thus human
sacrifices were practically extinct. The Peruvians had the institution
of a Holy Communion, in which they ate of a sacred bread, <i>sancu</i>,
sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificed sheep, the priest pronouncing
this formula: &ldquo;Take heed how ye eat this <i>sancu</i>; for he who
eats it in sin and with a double will and heart is seen by our Father,
the Sun, who will punish him with grievous troubles.&rdquo; The
Spaniards themselves recognised that the Mexicans ate the mystical body
of the God with every sign of devotion and contrition; and they were so
far from depreciating the Peruvian Communion that they supposed St.
Bartholomew had established it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3706src"
href="#xd21e3706" name="xd21e3706src">30</a></p>
<p>With these facts confronting us, it is nothing short of marvellous
to find many learned divines completely ignoring them in their
apologetic efforts. I say marvellous, for I assume they possess honesty
of purpose and some acquaintance with ancient beliefs; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>perhaps I am wrong in the latter assumption. The
continuance of the celebration of the Holy Eucharist until the present
day is held to be one of the evidences for the Christian faith, and
this on the ground that the rite could not have survived if Christ had
not founded it. For some reason, best known to the apologist, the
almost universal observance of the same ceremony, ages before the
Christian era, and its survival among the nations who finally adopted
Christianity, are entirely overlooked. Thus Dr. Maclear, in his book,
<i>The Evidential Value of the Holy Eucharist</i>, says: &ldquo;The
singular rite has survived all the vicissitudes of more than 1,000
years.... The early Christian would inform a supposed questioner that
the meal was a sacrificial feast, instituted by Him from Whom we are
called Christians, and Who died for us on the Cross. Here, then, we are
on solid ground. The rite, <i>so unique and so unprecedented</i>, rests
on an objective historical fact.&rdquo; One would think that Dr.
Maclear had entirely neglected the study of ancient and even modern
non-Christian<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3722src" href="#xd21e3722"
name="xd21e3722src">31</a> beliefs.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">VEGETATION GODS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is another class of primitive sacrificial custom
which claims our careful attention, in order that we may see whether it
manifests the beginning of a revelation from God. Even if we could
agree that all these gruesome details represent a savage&rsquo;s
glimmerings of the truth, we must allow that the theory collapses when
the object of the custom can be shown to have little or nothing to do
with religion in any true sense of the word. Subtle intellects are
capable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>of maintaining that the worship of ancestors, or
of the Sun, or of imaginary devils, betokens a dim perception of God;
but when it comes to the propitiation of a vegetation-god solely for
the sake of the material benefits expected to be derived from his cult,
surely it is time to dismiss the theory as worthless. &ldquo;All the
world over, savages and semi-civilised people are in the habit of
sacrificing human victims, whose bodies are buried in the field with
the seed of corn, or other bread stuffs. Often enough the
victim&rsquo;s blood is mixed with grain in order to fertilise it. The
most famous instance is that of the Khonds of Orissa, who chose special
victims, known as Meriahs, and offered them up to ensure good harvests.
The Meriah was often kept years before being sacrificed. He was
regarded as a consecrated being, and treated with extreme affection,
mingled with deference.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3732src"
href="#xd21e3732" name="xd21e3732src">32</a> &ldquo;The periodical
sacrifices,&rdquo; says Dr. Frazer, in <i>The Golden Bough</i>,
&ldquo;were generally so arranged by tribes and divisions of tribes
that each head of a family was enabled, at least once a year, to
procure a shred of flesh for his fields, generally about the time when
his chief crop was laid down.&rdquo; Khonds in distress often sold
their children as Meriahs, &ldquo;considering the beatification of
their souls certain, and their death, for the benefit of mankind, the
most honourable possible.&rdquo; Their children were representatives of
the Deity. With advancing civilisation we have the substitution of an
animal in place of the human representative of the God. In some cases
the worshippers tore the living animal to pieces with their teeth. The
rending and devouring of live bulls, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>calves, and goats
seems to have been a regular feature of the Dionysiac rites, the
participators in the orgy fancying that they were devouring the actual
body and blood of the god. With the further advance of civilisation
(or, according to the latest Christian theory, with the further advance
of God&rsquo;s revelation), as in the Mediterranean region, the bodies
of the gods of agriculture were eaten by their votaries in the shape of
cakes of bread, or other food stuffs, and their blood was drunk in the
form of wine.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3743src" href="#xd21e3743"
name="xd21e3743src">33</a></p>
<p>If Dr. Frazer be right as to the priority of the idea of a
vegetation-god in cults commonly associated with the Sun, then Krishna,
Osiris, Dionysus or Bacchus, Adonis, Attis, and other Saviours whose
deaths and resurrections were annually celebrated at the spring equinox
(our Easter), may have been primarily vegetation-victims, the abstract
ideas which identified the death and resurrection of the god with the
annual winter sleep and spring revival being finally fathered upon the
worship. Whatever explanation may be the correct one for the phenomenon
of a common mythos over the greater portion of the globe, it is
certainly not that of a Progressive Revelation. Such an explanation has
never been mooted by anyone but the Christian apologist. &ldquo;Among
early men and savages every act of life has a sacred significance, and
agriculture especially is everywhere and always invested with a special
sanctity. To us it would seem natural that the act of sowing seed
should be regarded as purely practical and physiological; that the seed
should be looked upon merely as the part of the plant intended for
reproduction, and that its germination <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>should be accepted as
a natural and normal process. Savages and early men, however, had no
such conceptions. To them the whole thing is a piece of natural
magic.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3750src" href="#xd21e3750"
name="xd21e3750src">34</a> Are we, then, to regard this working of
primitive thought as the working of the Holy Spirit? Surely we may
dismiss such a preposterous theory? It will serve the Church no good
purpose; for, while thinking men will be further than ever estranged,
it will furnish the militant agnostic with a fresh weapon for his
attacks upon her.</p>

<h4 class="main">WHY MEN EAT THEIR GOD.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Whatever may have been the ultimate origin of the idea
of God, and of the belief in His expiatory death and subsequent
resurrection, the origin of the custom of eating Him sacramentally
permits of a very simple explanation. &ldquo;Du Chaillu notes that some
of his West African followers, when going on an expedition, brought out
the skulls of their ancestors (which they religiously preserved) and
scraped off small portions of the bone, which they mixed with the water
and drank, giving as a reason for this conduct that their ancestors
were brave, and that by drinking a portion of them they too became
brave and fearless. Here we have a simple and early case of that habit
of &lsquo;eating the god&rsquo; to whose universality and importance
Dr. Frazer has called attention.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3760src" href="#xd21e3760" name="xd21e3760src">35</a> It is a
common early belief, which may still be met with, that by eating a
certain animal the consumer will become possessed of its qualities. It
is notorious, for instance, that the Miris of Northern <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>India prize tiger&rsquo;s flesh for men, because
it gives them strength and courage. And apparently the same belief
exists also in Southern India, for I remember our Madrassi ayah&mdash;a
Christian by the bye&mdash;begging for the hind leg of a panther (shot
by my wife), and explaining that she wanted to eat it in order to make
her <i>muzbut</i> (strong). I may mention also that certain religious
rites still in vogue among the Hindoos&mdash;disgusting as they are,
not only to our ideas, but in fact&mdash;arise from a similar
notion.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer discusses this primitive idea in his <i>Principles
of Sociology</i>. He explains how &ldquo;attributes or properties, as
we understand them, are not recognisable by the savage&mdash;are
abstractions which neither his faculties can grasp nor his language
express. Hence certain beliefs, everywhere conspicuous among the
uncivilised. A special potency which some object or part of an object
displays belongs to it in such a wise that it may be acquired by
consuming or possessing this object or part. The powers of a conquered
antagonist are supposed to be gained by devouring him. The Dakotah eats
the heart of a slain foe to increase his own courage; the New Zealander
swallows his dead enemy&rsquo;s eyes that he may see further; the
Abipone consumes tiger&rsquo;s flesh thinking so to gain the
tiger&rsquo;s strength and ferocity&mdash;cases which recall the legend
about Zeus devouring Metis that he might become possessed of her
wisdom. Clearly the implied mode of thought, shown even in the medical
prescriptions of past ages, is a mode of thought necessarily persisting
until analysis has disclosed the complexities of causal
relations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3775src" href="#xd21e3775"
name="xd21e3775src">36</a> &ldquo;The belief that the qualities
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>of any individual are appropriated by eating him
is illustrated by the statement of Stanbridge, that when Australians
kill an infant they feed an older child with it, believing &lsquo;that
by its eating as much as possible of the roasted infant it will possess
the strength of both.&rsquo; Elsewhere dead relations are consumed in
pursuance of an allied belief. We read of the Cucamas that, &lsquo;as
soon as a relation died, these people assembled and ate him roasted or
boiled, according as he was thin or fat!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3782src" href="#xd21e3782" name=
"xd21e3782src">37</a></p>
<p>It is easy, then, to understand why a savage should desire to
partake of the flesh of an animal or man whom he regards as divine. By
eating the body of the god he shares in the god&rsquo;s attributes and
powers. &ldquo;And when,&rdquo; as Dr. Frazer points out,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3789src" href="#xd21e3789" name=
"xd21e3789src">38</a> &ldquo;the god is a corn-god, the corn is his
proper body; when he is a vine-god, the juice of the grape is his
blood; and so by eating the bread and drinking the wine the worshipper
partakes of the real body and blood of the god.&rdquo; If the
apologist, nothing daunted, maintains that there is a religious germ in
these primitive superstitions, it is practically tantamount to saying
that every superstition contains such a germ; that superstition and
religion are, in fact, often synonymous terms. I thought it was only
the sceptic who said that. Before committing himself any further to a
supernatural theory which is so obviously untenable, I do entreat the
average apologist to read carefully the works of great thinkers who
have made primitive man their especial study. Let him read, for
instance, Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s <i>Principles of Sociology</i>, where
he will find a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>natural and mind-satisfying explanation of
primitive ideas concerning supernatural agents, ghosts, spirits,
demons, gods, resurrection, another life, inspiration, divination,
sacrifices, fasting, propitiation, and prayer. He will learn, also,
much that he ought to know concerning ancestor-worship, idol-worship,
fetish-worship, animal-worship, plant-worship, nature-worship, and the
heathen deities generally. He should also read Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden
Bough</i>, J. M. Robertson&rsquo;s <i>Pagan Christs</i> and
<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, and other scholarly and informing
works of this description, instead of confining his studies to works of
an apologetic character, where everything incompatible with existing
Christian theories is carefully omitted, or coloured out of all
recognition.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The resemblances to ancient myths are not confined to
the principal incidents in the life of Christ. Many of the most
noteworthy events related in the Old Testament have their counterpart
in widespread legends. That the stories of the Creation, Fall, and
Deluge are legends is well known&mdash;a visit to the British Museum
should convince the most captious critic on this point&mdash;but it is
not so well known that ancient folk-lore contains stories similar to
those of the Tower of Babel, the trial of Abraham&rsquo;s faith,
Jacob&rsquo;s vision of the ladder between earth and heaven, the
finding of Moses in an ark, the transformation of Moses&rsquo; rod into
a serpent, the Israelites&rsquo; passage through the Red Sea on dry
land, Moses smiting the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href=
"#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>rock and thus producing water, the
reception by Moses of the Ten Commandments from God, Balaam&rsquo;s
expostulating ass, Joshua&rsquo;s command to the sun and the
sun&rsquo;s obedience, Samson and his exploits, Elijah&rsquo;s ascent
to heaven, and Jonah&rsquo;s sojourn for three days and three nights in
the belly of a fish.</p>
<p>This Jonah episode has an important bearing on the subject under
discussion, as it is a typical case of an absorption of the universal
mythos. Among other authorities, Godfrey Higgins tells us: &ldquo;The
story of Jonas swallowed up by a whale is nothing but part of the
fiction of Hercules, described in the Heracleid or Labours of Hercules,
of whom the same story was told, and who was swallowed up at the very
same place, Joppa, and for the same period of time, three
days.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3824src" href="#xd21e3824"
name="xd21e3824src">39</a> Again, with the exception of those who
refuse to acknowledge anything damaging to the literal truth of Holy
Writ, all professors of theology are agreed that the miracle recorded
in the book of Jonah is not a historical fact. This in spite of the
alleged personal interviews with God as there recounted; while the plea
that we must make allowance for oriental imagery serves only to throw
discredit upon historians on whom we are relying for <i>facts</i> upon
which the scheme of Christianity depends. Now, the story of the three
days&rsquo; sojourn of Hercules and other heroes in the bowels of the
earth, or the belly of a fish, is only a different version of the myth
concerning the death and resurrection of a god which we find to be
prevalent over nearly the whole world. And, according to the new
Christian theory, this shows an intuition of Christ&rsquo;s death and
resurrection! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=

<h4 class="main">ANTICIPATIONS OF CHRISTIANITY IN SOLAR MYTHS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The advanced theologians, who are presenting us with
this theory, have to explain, among other things, how it was that
Christ himself took the &ldquo;Jonah and whale&rdquo; story seriously,
treating it as sober history. He spoke of no mere allegory when He
said: &ldquo;For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the
whale&rsquo;s belly; so shall the Son of Man be three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3839src" href="#xd21e3839" name="xd21e3839src">40</a> Neither
Christ himself nor the Apostles spoke of any revelation embodied in
<i>heathen</i> beliefs. Very much the reverse. Yet the Bishop of
Birmingham (late of Worcester), speaking to the adversaries of
Christianity, informs them: &ldquo;You say that we find in Christianity
the relics of paganism. On the contrary, we find in paganism,
intermingled with much that is false, superstitious, and horrible, the
<i>anticipations of Christianity</i>.&rdquo; Is that why we have paid
them the compliment of adopting their dates for the birth and death of
their Saviours?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3851src" href="#xd21e3851"
name="xd21e3851src">41</a> Canon P. H. Robinson goes so far as to say
that Christianity has benefited by the addition of heathen thought
[N.B. He owns there has been this addition], and that it is yet to
benefit by further contact with heathen thought! His actual words are:
&ldquo;<i>If Greek and Roman thought were needed for a full
appreciation of the meaning of the Incarnation, why may we not say the
same of Indian and Chinese thought? Surely we are justified in
believing that every country and every people have something to
contribute to Christianity and that the completion of the Christian
revelation awaits the contribution of each. We believe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>that
there are many important aspects of the Christian truth which have
never been understood, simply because Christianity has not yet been
reflected in the experience of those nations of the world which are
still heathen.</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3860src" href=

<h4 class="main">THE CHRISTIAN THEORY IGNORED BY SCIENCE.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The earliest attempts at a crude science of mythology
were efforts to reconcile the legends of the gods and heroes with the
religious sentiment which recognised in these beings objects of worship
and respect. When the Christians first approached the problem of
heathen mythology, they agreed with St. Augustine that the gods were
real persons&mdash;but diabolical, not divine. &ldquo;Some later
philosophers, especially of the seventeenth century, misled by the
resemblance between Biblical narratives and ancient myths, came to the
conclusion that the Bible contains a pure, the myths a distorted, form
of an original revelation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3870src"
href="#xd21e3870" name="xd21e3870src">43</a> Now, however, in tracing
myths and legends to their probable origins, the modern mythologist
never dreams of calling to his aid any supernatural theory.</p>
<p>Myths present, I take it, two main problems&mdash;first as to their
origin, and second as to their resemblances to Biblical narratives.
Some mythologists, while no longer allowing orthodox tradition to
hamper them, only profess to answer the first question. They disclaim
the obligation of entering the arena of theological controversy. It is
important that the Church should thoroughly realise this, and that any
disagreement there may be among mythologists as to the solution of the
first problem&mdash;the origin of myths&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>has
little or no bearing upon the solution of the second problem&mdash;the
Bible parallels. What does it matter whether the gods had a vegetable
or a solar origin, or arose, as Max M&uuml;ller thought, from &ldquo;a
disease of language&rdquo;? The all-important question for Christians
is: Can any of these possible origins point to a Progressive
Revelation, and, if not, how are we to account for the Bible
parallels?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch4.4.4">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE SUN AS A SYMBOL.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Suppose that, whatever the ultimate origin may have
been, certain myths containing the parallels are, as we know them,
solar myths (and on this point mythologists are now in complete
accord); how can a belief be, at one and the same time, a solar myth
and also an allegory expressing a spiritual truth? The sun is the
object of worship, and its apparent movements give rise to myths
concerning the birth, death, and resurrection of a Saviour.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3884src" href="#xd21e3884" name=
"xd21e3884src">44</a> Can we call this Progressive Revelation?
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; the apologists may reply; &ldquo;is there no
bright Sun of Righteousness&mdash;no personal and loving Son of God, of
whom the material sun has been the type or symbol, in all ages and
among all nations? What power is it that comes from the sun to give
light and heat to all created things? If the symbolical sun leads such
a great and heavenly flock, what must be said of the true and only
begotten Son of God? If Apollo was adopted by early Christian art as a
type of the Good Shepherd of the New Testament, this interpretation of
the sun-god among all nations must be the solution of the universal
mythos. What other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span>solution can it have? To what other
historical personage but Christ can it apply? If this mythos has no
spiritual meaning, all religion becomes mere idolatry, or the worship
of material things.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3889src" href=
"#xd21e3889" name="xd21e3889src">45</a></p>
<p>Will this sort of reasoning satisfy the average man? To begin with,
the sun-worshippers themselves had no idea that the sun was, as is now
alleged, the symbol of a great Truth. The sun, or their conception of
the sun as a divine person in a blazing car, was the object of their
worship. What a waste of worship for thousands upon thousands of
years!&mdash;worship that might have been centred upon the true God.
Even now, nigh on 2,000 years after God was pleased at last to reveal
Himself, as we are told, to all mankind, the greater portion do not
know Him, or they deny Him. If God intended the sun to be a symbol of
Christ, why have we never been told this before? Why even now is it
only put forward by a certain school of apologists in costly books that
few will ever set their eyes upon? It is noteworthy, too, that the
horrors that accompanied the worship of this same &ldquo;bright
Sun&rdquo; are discreetly kept in the background by these advocates of
the &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; theory.</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 5. <i>Concluding Remarks on Christian and
Anti-Christian Theories.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If Progressive Revelation be true, it is the most
marvellous proof of the truth of Christianity&mdash;far the greatest
proof that has ever yet been presented to us. Far greater, for
instance, than the prophecies of those so-called prophets of the Old
Testament, who, it now transpires, were only anticipating or describing
events of their own times. It is such a proof as Christianity is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>in dire need of just now&mdash;a proof that will
save her from a peril which every hour brings nearer. Why, then, do we
hear so little of this great discovery from the pulpit?<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3906src" href="#xd21e3906" name=
"xd21e3906src">46</a> How comes it that it is discovered so many years
after the fulfilment of these unconscious prophecies of the pagans? Why
is it produced merely to confute the sceptic and restore confidence to
that infinitesimally small number who happen to have studied, and
therefore to have had their suspicions aroused by, Comparative
Mythology? We are to believe that God revealed Himself by an
exceedingly slow and painful process, extending over thousands upon
thousands of years, and entailing the most horrible customs among
savages. This process, mark you, not only led to the establishment of
Christianity as the world became more civilised, but to the
establishment of those other great religions which to this day are
hostile to the reception of Christianity! Simple-minded people will
never be induced to agree that revelation can be progressive in the
manner now indicated to us by the apologist. Rather they will agree
with the nationalist, who denies the originality of Christianity,
contending that it is a cult which adopted, step by step, the
mysteries, the miracles, and the myths of the popular Gentile
religions. Some freethinkers, indeed, go so far as to say that the
whole Gospel story is nothing more than a myth; but the greater number
consider that there is a substratum of truth, and that round this have
slowly gathered the religious ideas and doctrines that were current in
the old pagan world. The precise manner in which, they conjecture, the
transformation actually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>took place is a large subject, and
there are differences of opinion&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, some are inclined
to think that Essenism, others that Mithraism, played a leading part;
but the point to be borne in mind is that there is no difficulty
whatever in understanding how the absorption of myths could have taken
place, or how the Christian cult could have arisen and prospered.</p>
<p>I especially mention this, as some apologists argue that there was
not sufficient time for heathen accretions between the death of Jesus
and the writing of the Gospels. I can only reiterate the remark of the
well-known professor of Church history, Dr. Harnack: &ldquo;We know
that the Gospels come from a time in which the marvellous may be said
to have been something of almost daily occurrence. <i>We now know that
eminent persons have not to wait until they have been long dead, or
even for several years, to have miracles reported of them; they are
reported at once, often the very next day.</i>&rdquo; Also, I should
call attention to the notes on Essenism and Mithraism at the close of
this chapter, as they contain the answer to this final objection. But,
personally, I fail to see how the &ldquo;time&rdquo; objection can in
any case be maintained when we remember that the whole world had
already been conversant for ages past with stories of suffering
Saviours, similar in all essentials to the Gospel narratives. Besides,
we know that documents have been tampered with more or less (the
sceptic says &ldquo;more,&rdquo; the apologist &ldquo;less&rdquo;), and
that the composition of the Gospels took place many years after the
events they purport to describe; while the age was one when men were
extremely credulous, and when, consciously and unconsciously, imposing
upon this credulity was the ordinary method of propagating a Faith.

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch4.5.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">ARGUMENT FROM ESSENISM.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Regarding the difficulty of supposing that Jesus or
the Evangelists could have been imbued with any sun-myth ideas, we must
take into consideration the existence at that time of the Jewish sect,
the Essenes. It seems quite possible that they considered Jesus of
Nazareth to be the Messiah they were expecting, and that they came over
to Christianity in a body. This monastic brotherhood, living in
settlements in the desert west of the Dead Sea&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
within a day&rsquo;s journey of Bethlehem and Jerusalem&mdash;not only
placed love of God, of goodness, and of man as articles in their
programme, but also sought with wonderful energy, according to their
lights, to realise them in their life. Bunsen assures us (p. 158 of his
<i>Angel-Messiah</i>), and furnishes strong grounds for his opinion,
that the Essenes introduced the new doctrine of an Angel-Messiah, and
with it the doctrine of the atoning death of the Messiah, into Judaism
and Christianity. Canon Cheyne likewise places them among the number of
those who prepared the way for the new world-religion. This seems to
have been the very reason of their disappearance in the second century
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>&mdash;Christianity dissolved them. So much
so that the Essenes (often called Therapeut&aelig; or healers) are
identified by Eusebius with the Christian monks, and this opinion was
generally adopted by the Fathers (see chap, xvii., bk. ii., p. 117, of
<i>The Church History of Eusebius</i>, translated by the Rev. A. C.
McGiffert, under the editorial supervision of Henry Wace, D.D., and
Philip Schaff, D.D.).</p>
<p>From a perusal of the article on the &ldquo;Essenes&rdquo; in the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i>, it will be seen that Essenism is not
a purely Jewish product, but that &ldquo;Persian and Babylonian
influence may reasonably be admitted.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oriental influences
were,&rdquo; Canon Cheyne informs us, &ldquo;so to speak, in the air,
and it is probable that the belief in the resurrection was not the only
great debt which Jewish religionists owed to Zoroastrians.&rdquo;
Bishop Lightfoot describes the Essenes as sun-worshippers. Is there,
then, no likelihood of Jesus and His disciples being familiar with the
ideas of sun-worshippers? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=
"#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>But, it may be urged, the teaching of Jesus Christ was opposed to
Essenic doctrines in the matter of asceticism. True; but, in one way,
this makes the case for the absorption of Essenic ideas all the
stronger, for it would account for the strange fact that the Christians
approved of asceticism in spite of their own Master&rsquo;s example to
the contrary. I do not wish to press this anti-Christian theory further
than to say that it appears to me that, among others, it is one
deserving of consideration. Presuming that in Jesus the Apostles were
confronted with a personality of overwhelming attractiveness and power
of appeal to themselves, their language can be interpreted throughout
as their attempt to expound and pass on their experience to the world.
In this attempt they were naturally driven to employ such conceptions
as were current in their day, and notably those of Messianic
anticipations and Greek philosophy. Assuming that the Gospels are
without any important interpolations, and that the authors are the
Evangelists, even then the partial insertion of solar-myths would not
necessarily be tantamount to any conscious dishonesty on the part of
the Evangelists; it only points to their impregnation with the Jewish
beliefs, such as those of the Essenes, that were around them. If this
theory be correct, the difficulty arising from the shortness of the
time between the Resurrection and the writing of the Gospels vanishes,
since accretions of a later date would no longer be the sole cause for
the events recorded by the Evangelists becoming inextricably entwined
with mythical beliefs.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">ARGUMENT FROM MITHRAISM.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This argument is fully developed in Part III. of Mr.
J. M. Robertson&rsquo;s book, <i>Pagan Christs</i>, from which the
following are quotations: &ldquo;Mithraism was in point of range the
most nearly universal religion of the Western world in the early
centuries of the Christian era. As to this students are agreed. [Here
Mr. Robertson gives in a footnote a formidable array of authorities.]
To the early Fathers, we shall see. Mithraism was a most serious thorn
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>in the flesh; and the monumental remains of the
Roman period, in almost all parts of the empire, show its extraordinary
extension.&rdquo; Mr. Robertson points out that there are a number of
monuments in honour of Mithra in England, France, Italy, Germany, and
in many Mediterranean ports. He then proceeds to give us some
exceedingly important information regarding Mithraism, out of which I
select the following extracts for the more particular attention of
Christians:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the culture of Mithra as the Sun-god, the deity of
light and truth, created by, and yet co-equal with, the Supreme Deity,
and fighting on the side of the good against the evil power,
Angra-Mainyu (Ahriman)&mdash;this at a period long before the Christian
era.... Mithra comes to occupy a singular position as between the two
great powers of good and evil, Ormuzd and Ahriman, being actually named
the Mediator, and figuring to the devout eye as a humane and beneficent
God, nearer to man than the Great Spirit of Good, a Saviour, a
Redeemer, eternally young, son of the Most High, and preserver of
mankind from the Evil One.... The first day of the week, Sunday, was
apparently from time immemorial consecrated to Mithra by the
Mithraists; and as the Sun-god was pre-eminently &lsquo;the
Lord,&rsquo; Sunday was the &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s Day&rsquo; long before
the Christian era.... We have some exact information as to the two
chief Mithraic ceremonies or festivals, those of Christmas and Easter,
the winter solstice and the vernal equinox, the birthday of the
Sun-god, and the period of his sacrifice and his triumph.... There were
in antiquity, we know from Porphyry, several elaborate treatises
setting forth the religion of Mithra; and every one of these has been
destroyed by the care of the Church.... Of course, we are told that the
Mithraic rites and mysteries are borrowed and imitated from
Christianity. The refutation of this notion, as has been pointed out by
M. Havet, lies in the language of those Christian fathers who spoke of
Mithraism. Three of them, as we have seen, speak of the Mithraic
resemblances to Christian rites as being the work of devils. Now, if
the Mithraists <i>had</i> simply imitated the historic Christians, the
obvious course for the latter would be simply to say so.... The
Mithraic mysteries, then, of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>the burial and resurrection of the
Lord, the Mediator, the Saviour; burial in a rock tomb and resurrection
from the tomb; the sacrament of bread and water, the marking on the
forehead with a mystic mark&mdash;all these were in practice before the
publication of the Christian Gospel.... Nor was this all. Firmicus
informs us that the devil, in order to leave nothing undone for the
destruction of souls, had beforehand resorted to deceptive imitations
of the <i>Cross</i> of Christ.... Still further does the parallel hold.
It is well known that, whereas in the Gospels Jesus is said to have
been born in an inn-stable, early Christian writers, as Justin Martyr
and Origen, explicitly say he was born in a cave. Now, in the Mithra
myth, Mithra is both rock-born and born in a cave; and the monuments
show the new-born babe adored by shepherds who offer first-fruits....
Now, however, arises the great question. How came such a cultus to die
out of the Roman and Byzantine Empire after making its way so far, and
holding its ground so long? The answer to that question has never, I
think, been fully given, and is for the most part utterly evaded,
though part of it has been suggested often enough. The truth is
Mithraism was not overthrown; it was merely transformed.... Though
Mithraism had many attractions, Christianity had more, having
sedulously copied every one of its rivals and developed special
features of its own.... In the Christian legend the God was humanised
in the most literal way; and for the multitude the concrete deity must
needs replace the abstract. The Gospels gave a literal story: The
Divine Man was a carpenter, and ate and drank with the poorest of the
poor.... Gradually the very idea of allegory died out of the Christian
intelligence; and priests as well as people came to take everything
literally and concretely.... This was the religion for the Dark
Ages.... Byzantines and barbarians alike were held by literalism, not
by the unintelligible: for both alike the symbol had to become a
fetish; and for the Dark Ages the symbol of the cross was much more
plausibly appealing than that of the god slaying the zodiacal bull....
A Mithraist could turn to the Christian worship and find his main rites
unimpaired, lightened only of the burden of initiative austerities,
stripped of the old obscure mysticism, and with all things turned to
the literal and the concrete, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"
href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>sympathy with the waning of
knowledge and philosophy throughout the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I must now close these quotations, apologising to Mr. Robertson
for making such a free use of his book, and advising my readers to
study it. They will find that his facts are reliable; they are all
backed by the highest authorities, however much the conclusions drawn
from them may, at present, be a matter of opinion. Suffice it to say
here that the coincidences between Mithraism and Christianity are
indescribably marvellous, and require further explanation, if Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s theory of the absorption of the former by the latter
be not very largely true. Whatever the substratum of real history may
be, there is no doubt that there was every opportunity for an early
absorption of Mithraism, and every probability that it took place to an
extent which throws a new flood of light upon many Christian doctrines.
&ldquo;The first six centuries were characterised by fierce
controversies as to the most fundamental verities of the Christian
faith, by the wholesale introduction of adult converts, who brought
with them heathen and Jewish habits of thought, and who were in many
cases of a low type of civilisation; and the adulteration of the Gospel
was further facilitated by the purely nominal adhesion of persons
anxious to stand well with the first Christian Emperors. The period was
one of incessant fermentation and of rapid and continuous
change.&rdquo; These are not the words of Mr. Robertson, nor of any
other freethinker, but are an extract from the resolution adopted by
the Church Association in connection with the appeal by Dean Wace and
others to the authority of the First Six Centuries. What a period to
appeal to! When we know what we do of the credulity and the methods of
those &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; of the Church, how can any rational being
place in them any confidence whatsoever?</p>
<p>What steps do the Churches propose to take concerning these
disclosures? Will they proclaim from the pulpit their new theory of a
Progressive Revelation, or will they by their silence evince their own
want of faith in this precious theory, and allow the storm of unbelief
slowly to gather force until it bursts and overwhelms the Christian
belief? Knowledge of the facts, so ably discussed by Mr. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>Robertson, will soon be widely disseminated. Let
there be no mistake on this point. Here, for instance, are some
instructive passages appearing on page 496 of the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>, September, 1905:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been truly observed that the recovery, only partial as
it is, of the history of this religion [the Mithraic] is one of the
most remarkable triumphs of historical and antiquarian research.
Originating in Persia, it was spread through the Roman Empire by poor
and humble converts, who were at first mainly soldiers; but gradually,
like Christianity, it permeated all ranks, and its temples are found
scattered over the whole civilised world, from Babylon to the hills of
Scotland. Just as the religion of Isis did, it resembled that of Christ
in being a religion of inward holiness, of austere self-discipline and
purity; but the details of its resemblance are incomparably more close
and curious. The briefest sketch of the matter is all that can be
attempted here. According to Mithraic theology, God considered in His
totality is a Being so infinite and so transcendent that His direct
connection with man and the universe is inconceivable. In order to
become the father of man and creator, He manifested Himself in a second
personality&mdash;namely, Mithra, who was in his cosmic character
identified with the &lsquo;unconquered sun,&rsquo; and, as a moral and
intellectual Being, was the Divine Word or Reason, and, in more senses
than one, &lsquo;the mediator&rsquo; between man and the Most High.
Life on earth, according to the Mithraic doctrine, is for man a time of
trial. The Spirit of Evil, his adversary, is always seeking to destroy
him&mdash;to crush him with pain and sorrow, or to stain his soul with
concupiscence; but in all his struggles Mithra is at hand to aid him,
and will at the last day be at once his judge and advocate, when the
graves give up their dead, when the just are separated from the unjust,
when the saved are welcomed like children into eternal bliss, and the
lost are consumed in the fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.
This Divine Saviour came into the world as an infant. His first
worshippers were shepherds; and the day of His nativity was December
25th. His followers preached a severe and rigid morality, chief among
their virtues being temperance, chastity, renunciation, and
self-control. They kept the seventh day holy, and the middle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>day of each month was a special feast of Mithra,
which symbolised his function of Mediator. They had seven sacraments,
of which the most important were baptism, confirmation, and a
Eucharistic supper, at which the communicants partook of the divine
nature of Mithra under the species of bread and wine.&rdquo;

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">General views of the development or evolution of the
visible order of nature have been entertained by philosophers from the
earliest historical times. There were pioneers of Evolution from Thales
to Lucretius (600 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>&ndash;50 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>). The inquiry was then arrested for nearly sixteen
hundred years&mdash;that is, until the renascence of Science. As
knowledge, in spite of ecclesiastical discouragement, again slowly
advanced, the science of biology gained in strength, and the work of
Linn&aelig;us, Buffon, Lamarck, Erasmus Darwin, and others, paved the
way for that modern theory of Evolution which Darwin, Wallace, Spencer,
Huxley, and Haeckel have demonstrated to us. This doctrine of Evolution
is no longer a mere speculative theory, possibly or probably true, but
an established fact accepted by the whole scientific world with hardly
a single dissentient voice. We know that everything as it now exists is
the product of Evolution&mdash;the solar system, the earth, all lower
forms of life, and lastly man, together with his languages, arts,
sciences, theology, social habits, instincts, and, according to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>many high authorities, morals, conscience, and
consciousness. Yes, &ldquo;man, perfect as he may appear to us, is
still not a being apart in nature, but by his whole organisation is
continuous with the other zoological species.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Anthropology, properly so-called, is, in fact, merely a chapter
of zoology.&rdquo; &ldquo;The homological structure of man, his
embryological development, and the rudiments which he still retains,
all declare in the plainest possible manner that he is descended from
some lower form.&rdquo; He &ldquo;derives his moral sense from the
social feelings which are instinctive or innate in the lower
animals.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4009src" href="#xd21e4009"
name="xd21e4009src">1</a></p>
<p>It is in the special sense of explaining how living things came into
being, and how they have acquired their present characters, that the
teaching of Evolution appears to be most in conflict with that of the
Churches and the Bible. It is, therefore, this aspect of Evolution with
which we are here chiefly concerned, and we may remember that, since
Charles Darwin published his <i>Origin of Species</i> (1859) and
<i>Descent of Man</i> (1871), his <i>main</i> conclusions have been
confirmed by every branch of anthropological research&mdash;by
pal&aelig;ontology, zoology, comparative anatomy, physiology,
pathology, teratology, psychology, and more especially by embryology, a
science in which there has been a remarkable progress during the past
thirty years. Professor Haeckel points out on page 24 of his important
work, <i>The Evolution of Man</i> (translated by Joseph McCabe), that
&ldquo;even when human anatomy began to stir itself once more in the
sixteenth century, and independent research into the structure of the
developed body was resumed, anatomists did not dare <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>to
extend their inquiries to the unformed body, the embryo, and its
development. There were many reasons for the prevailing horror of such
studies. It is natural enough, when we remember that a Bull of Boniface
VIII. excommunicated every man who ventured to dissect a human corpse.
If the dissection of a developed body were a crime to be thus punished,
how much more dreadful must it have seemed to deal with the embryonic
body still enclosed in the womb, which the Creator Himself had decently
veiled from the curiosity of the scientist.&rdquo; Pal&aelig;ontology
is another very young science that has contributed greatly towards the
evidence of our origin. Professor Huxley informs us, in his essay on
&ldquo;The Rise and Progress of Pal&aelig;ontology,&rdquo; that the
first adequate investigation of the fossil remains of any large group
of vertebrated animals dates from 1822, and that in the last fifty
years the number of known fossil remains of invertebrated animals has
been trebled or quadrupled. Fossils were at one time believed to have
been sown by the devil, whose fell purpose was to throw discredit upon
the Bible story of Creation. Perhaps this pious opinion may have had
something to do with the slow progress of pal&aelig;ontology?</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch5.1.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">DARWINISM.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To prevent the chance of any misunderstanding, some
explanation may be necessary for the benefit of those who are not in
touch with scientific thought, and who hear that
&ldquo;Darwinism&rdquo; is out of date. They should understand that,
although the doctrine of Evolution as applied to organic life used to
be widely spoken of by the term &ldquo;Darwinism,&rdquo; the latter is
now only used by scientists in a special <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>sense, to designate
the belief in the gradual origin of species by natural selection. There
are some who deem this hypothesis to be untenable. But there is no
dispute whatever concerning the doctrine of the derivation or descent,
with modification, of all existing species, genera, orders, classes,
etc., of animals and plants, from a few simple forms of life, if not
from one. Modern evolutionary theories, however, are more particularly
concerned with the question of the ways and means by which living
organisms have assumed their actual characters or forms, and on these
points there are many shades of individual opinion.</p>
<p>Ignorance of the gist of the Darwinian theory, &ldquo;natural
selection,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4040src" href="#xd21e4040"
name="xd21e4040src">2</a> has been fruitful in misunderstandings and
objections regarding it, so that it is advisable to mention here that
the author of the theory states explicitly that it does not account for
the origin of variations in individuals, still less in species; but
that, given the origination and existence of variations, it shows that
some of these are preserved, while others are not&mdash;that favourable
variations tend to be perpetuated, and unfavourable variations to
become extinct; that those variations which best adapt an organisation
to its environment are most favourable to its preservation, and,
consequently, that the theory of natural selection is adequate to
explain the observed fact of the survival of the fittest in the
struggle for existence. &ldquo;Natural selection ... implies that the
individuals which are best fitted for the complex and changing
conditions to which, in the course of ages, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>they
are exposed, generally survive and procreate their
kind.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4048src" href="#xd21e4048"
name="xd21e4048src">3</a> Natural selection does not, it may be added,
imply conscious selection. It would be equally true to call it natural
murder, or natural weeding-out. But, whether Darwin and Weismann be
right or wrong in attributing so much to natural selection, what I wish
particularly to point out is that the hypothesis of Evolution is nowise
invalidated because, out of the various causes at work, we are not
quite sure as yet which is the most efficient. It is necessary to make
this clear, for, hearing that &ldquo;Darwinism&rdquo; is under dispute,
the uninitiated might come to the conclusion that the animal origin of
man is discredited.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch5.1.3">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE AVERAGE PERSON&rsquo;S IDEAS ON THE EVOLUTION OF
MAN.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With but very few exceptions, every biological student
admits our animal origin. The ideas of most people, however, on this
subject are hazy in the extreme, and no wonder, when the study of
Evolution has never been included in their school curriculum. Men (and
in very rare cases women) pick up a few crumbs of knowledge concerning
the scientific theory of their origin, and then, from want of leisure
or from religious motives, or from various causes, they drop the
subject. Often they are put off by the dry details of the evidence and
the technical phrases before they have obtained a real grip of the
subject. They do not even know some of the more simple and obvious
proofs which alone would have sufficed to convince them. One finds that
men&rsquo;s views concerning Evolution are coloured by the opinion
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>prevailing at the time when they themselves were
once faintly interested in the subject; and thus there is, at present,
an inertia of ignorance, due to the misconceptions and prejudices of
older generations. The opinions of our elders, being formed on a riper
experience, very properly enlist our respect; but, unfortunately, in
this instance they are based upon false premises, and so lead us
astray. People who remember when Darwin first propounded his theory,
and the violent, not to say virulent, opposition with which it was
received by the Church, only too often remain in blissful ignorance of
all that has since transpired. It is quite enough for them that they
are erect, tailless, speaking, reflecting bipeds. With attributes such
as these, they fondly imagine that they are separated from the beast by
a gulf that neither Evolution nor any other theory could possibly
bridge. Whatever the reasons may be&mdash;and there are many&mdash;the
vast majority of Christians not only remain woefully ignorant of
Evolution, but have no desire to learn anything more about it. They
know it is opposed to Bible teaching. They prefer, as it has been well
said, to consider themselves fallen angels rather than elevated
apes.</p>
<p>We are not, however, concerned here with likes and dislikes, but
only with the truth as far as our reason allows us to discover it.
Moreover, if it be objected that we can take no pride in an animal
ancestry, surely we may say the same of our savage ancestry. &ldquo;He
who has seen a savage in his native land will not feel much shame if
forced to acknowledge that the blood of some more humble creature flows
in his veins. For my own part, I would as soon be descended from that
heroic little monkey, who braved his dreaded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>enemy in order to save the life of his keeper;
or from that old baboon, who, descending from the mountains, carried
away in triumph his young comrade from a crowd of astonished dogs, as
from a savage who delights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody
sacrifices, practises infanticide without remorse, treats his wives
like slaves, knows no decency, and is haunted by the grossest
superstitions.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4065src" href=
"#xd21e4065" name="xd21e4065src">4</a> &ldquo;We must acknowledge, as
it seems to me, that man, with all his noble qualities, with sympathy
which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not
only to other men, but to the humblest living creature, with his
god-like intellect, which has penetrated into the movement and
constitution of the solar system&mdash;with all these exalted
powers&mdash;man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of
his lowly origin.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4071src" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now let us consider the opinions of our spiritual
guides. At the Shrewsbury Church Conference, in 1896, Archbishop Temple
said that, &ldquo;in his opinion, the full acceptance of the doctrine
of Evolution would prove a great help to Christian thought and
Christian life.&rdquo; In his book, <i>The Relations between Religion
and Science</i>, he states that &ldquo;the doctrine of Evolution leaves
the argument for an intelligent and beneficent Creator and Governor of
the world stronger than it was before.&rdquo; A decade has passed, and
still how few Christians know of this &ldquo;help,&rdquo; of this
&ldquo;stronger argument&rdquo;! In the course of his address at the
Weymouth Church Conference in 1905, the Bishop of Gloucester admitted
that &ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s teaching <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>on evolution and
development&rdquo; had &ldquo;revolutionised our ideas of God&rsquo;s
action in nature.&rdquo; If this be so, how comes it that such a vast
number of the pious still adhere to the old ideas? Is it not the duty
of the pastor to educate his flock? What &ldquo;ideas of God&rsquo;s
action in nature&rdquo; are missionaries even now putting into the
heads of their converts? If we inquired of the average religionist,
should we find that his or her ideas had been revolutionised? Not only
are worshippers in the House of God kept in ignorance, but theological
students are distinctly warned against the full acceptance of the
doctrine of Evolution. For instance, Dr. Orr, a professor of
apologetics, delivered a course of lectures before the professors and
students of the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1903, the object of
which was to show the dangers that must accrue to the Faith if the
theories of Darwin were accepted in their entirety. He stoutly denied
that man and woman were an evolution by slow stages from creatures that
had gone before, and asserted that the first man came into being, as
did the first woman, by a special act of creation. Unfortunately for
the validity of his assertion he labours under the delusion that
science concedes that man, or anything like man, cannot be traced
further back than the post-glacial period, and that the brain capacity
and physical characteristics of primeval man stood on as high a level
as the average man of to-day!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4085src" href=
"#xd21e4085" name="xd21e4085src">6</a></p>
<p>In a recently-published letter,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4093src"
href="#xd21e4093" name="xd21e4093src">7</a> written by Charles
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>Kingsley to a correspondent, we read: &ldquo;My
own belief in the general truth of my friend Darwin&rsquo;s
views&mdash;which deepen day by day as I verify them&mdash;has only
given me wider and deeper and nobler notions of God&rsquo;s works in
the material universe.&rdquo; He then proceeds to illustrate his own
thoughts by a charming little story of a certain old heathen Khan, who
was delighted with the idea of a God so wise that <i>he made all things
make themselves</i>. This old Khan and Charles Kingsley overlook an
objection which to myself, and to many others, seems quite
insuperable&mdash;namely, that a God so wise and merciful would have
seen his way to prevent that frightful wastefulness and cruelty which
is part and parcel of the evolutionary process. But more of this
difficulty anon.</p>
<p>To give another example of a clerical evolutionist: the Rev. G. S.
Streatfield, vicar of Christ Church, Hampstead, on May 22nd, 1901, read
a paper at the Southport Conference on &ldquo;Questions that Must be
Faced,&rdquo; in which he conceded that &ldquo;the fact of Evolution is
now hardly questioned in the scientific world&mdash;one might almost
say in the world of thought.&rdquo; He, too, is charmed with the new
theory, for he says: &ldquo;It is, I suppose, generally agreed that the
evolutionist has worthier, more rational, more truly philosophical
views of the Divine Will and Action than those who hold the traditional
theory.&rdquo; Clerics of his stamp and school are now becoming more
outspoken, and admit their convictions in public instead of in writings
that are likely to be seen only by a select few. Only lately the Dean
of Westminster, addressing a large gathering of Sunday-school teachers,
told them that the idea that the human species was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>separately created was given up, and the fact of
man&rsquo;s descent from lower organisms accepted. While admiring his
candour, one cannot help calling to mind that in 1860 Professor Huxley
was utterly ridiculed by erudite scholars of the Church for making a
precisely similar statement.</p>
<p>Between those who accept and those who entirely reject Evolution
there are various shades of opinion. There are those who accept
everything short of the evolution of certain mental faculties; although
students of comparative psychology now admit that the intellectual
faculties of animals differ from those in man in degree only, not in
their essence. There are those like the Rev. John Urquhart, author of a
brochure called <i>Roger&rsquo;s Reasons</i>, who seek to reconcile the
Bible story of creation with the Evolution theory, although any such
interpretation was put out of court long ago by Professor
Huxley&rsquo;s reply to Mr. Gladstone.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4110src" href="#xd21e4110" name="xd21e4110src">8</a> There are
those who, like Dr. Torrey,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4119src" href=
"#xd21e4119" name="xd21e4119src">9</a> persist in altogether denying
our animal origin, although there is hardly a single scientist, hardly
a single thoughtful man, who has studied the subject without bias, who
believes anything else. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>The number of clergymen who openly admit the truth of Evolution is
as yet comparatively small. The few who do express their opinion
openly, profess to be delighted with the new light that has now been
shed upon God&rsquo;s methods. The question arises, How is it, then,
that we hear so little about Evolution from the pulpit, and that,
consequently, the faithful are kept in ignorance of this fresh
revelation? The answer is obvious: It is because the advanced divines
have yet to educate their congregations up to their way of thinking,
and the process has, for many reasons, to be conducted with extreme
caution. They know full well that they have a difficult and dangerous
task before them; that those who accept Evolution, but are unable to
accept their opinions concerning its spiritual helpfulness, will lapse
into agnosticism. They also know that their views are not popular with
conservative believers.</p>
<p>The chief reason, perhaps, for pulpit reticence is that the enormous
majority in the Church still remain hostile to this new doctrine. They
consider it to be dangerous, and likely to unsettle people&rsquo;s
minds. Possibly in their inmost souls, if they have studied Evolution
at all, they agree with a certain distinguished essayist who says:
&ldquo;A God who could have been deliberately guilty of them (the
Evolutionary processes) would be a God too absurd, too monstrous, too
mad to be credible.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4133src" href=
"#xd21e4133" name="xd21e4133src">10</a> The cruelty of the law of prey
and struggle for existence, and the wastefulness of Nature&rsquo;s
arrangements for the reproduction of life (plant and animal alike), do,
indeed, appear sufficient warrant for some such painful impression;
while, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>if this were not enough, there is for the
Christian the additional difficulty of reconciling Evolution with the
Bible story of the Creation and Fall of man. These various difficulties
must now be carefully investigated.</p>

a cod is said to contain, developed into adult codfishes, the sea would
quickly become a solid mass of them. It is the same with the plants.
The lower organisms multiply with an astonishing rapidity, some minute
fungi increasing a billion-fold in a few hours. But we need not give
further examples of this fecundity whereby Nature, &lsquo;so careless
of the single life,&rsquo; secures the race against extinction. The
result is obvious&mdash;a ceaseless struggle for food and place. In
that struggle the race is to the swift, and the battle to the strong;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>the weaker, be it in brain or body, going to the
wall; the vast majority never reaching maturity, or, if they do,
attaining it only to be starved or slain. As among men competition is
sharper between those of the same trade, so throughout the organic
world the struggle is less severe between different species than
between members of the same species, because these compete more
fiercely for their common needs&mdash;plants for the same soil,
carnivora for the same prey.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4156src"
href="#xd21e4156" name="xd21e4156src">12</a></p>
<p>The problem of evil has exercised the mind of man from all time, and
has never yet been solved. In our own time the solution <i>by
theology</i> seems farther off than ever, now that the existence of the
Devil is denied, while the law of prey and struggle for existence is
admitted to be the Creator&rsquo;s own handiwork&mdash;to be His Divine
plan for the evolution of all living things. Surely we must admit the
inherent cruelty of the process? Professor Huxley, in an article on the
&ldquo;Struggle for Existence,&rdquo; concludes that, &ldquo;since
thousands of times a minute, were our ears sharp enough, we should hear
sighs and groans of pain like those heard by Dante at the gate of hell
[not to mention what we should <i>not</i> hear&mdash;the anguish and
terror borne in silence], the world cannot be governed by what we call
benevolence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4170src" href=
"#xd21e4170" name="xd21e4170src">13</a></p>
<p>Winwood Reade, in his striking book, <i>The Martyrdom of Man</i>,
says: &ldquo;But it is when we open the Book of Nature, that book
inscribed in blood and tears; it is when we study the laws regulating
life, the laws productive of development, that we see plainly how
illusive is this theory that God is Love. In all things <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>there is cruel, profligate, and abandoned waste.
Of all the animals that are born a few only can survive; and it is
owing to this law that development takes place. The law of murder is
the law of growth. Life is one long tragedy; creation is one great
crime. Is it the law of a kind Creator that no animal shall rise to
excellence except by being fatal to the life of others? It is useless
to say that pain has its benevolence, that massacre has its mercy. Why
is it so ordained that bad should be the raw material of good? Pain is
not less pain because it is useful; murder is not less murder because
it is conducive to development. <i>There is blood upon the hand still,
and all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten it.</i>&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4185src" href="#xd21e4185" name=
"xd21e4185src">14</a></p>
<p>Robert Blatchford (Nunquam), in his book, <i>God and My
Neighbour</i>, which has caused no little stir of late in certain
quarters, speaks to the same effect: &ldquo;On land and in sea the
animal creation chase and maim and slay and devour each other. The
beautiful swallow on the wing devours the equally beautiful gnat. The
graceful flying fish, like a fair white bird, goes glancing above the
blue magnificence of the tropical seas. His flight is one of terror; he
is pursued by the ravenous dolphin. The ichneumon-fly lays eggs under
the skin of the caterpillar. The eggs are hatched by the warmth of the
caterpillar&rsquo;s blood. They produce a brood of larv&aelig; which
devour the caterpillar <i>alive</i>.... A germ flies from a stagnant
pool, and the laughing child, its mother&rsquo;s darling, dies
dreadfully of diphtheria. A tidal wave rolls land-ward, and twenty
thousand human beings are drowned or crushed to death. A volcano bursts
suddenly into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>eruption, and the beautiful city is a heap of
ruins, and its inhabitants are charred or mangled corpses. And the
Heavenly Father, who is Love and has power to save, makes no sign....
Only man helps man. Only man pities; only man <i>tries</i> to
save.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; it may be said, &ldquo;you are giving only the
one side&mdash;the freethinker&rsquo;s side&mdash;of the question. What
are the Christian evolutionist&rsquo;s replies to these terrible
attacks upon our Heavenly Father?&rdquo; You shall hear them, and judge
for yourself whether they are likely to convince the multitude.</p>
<p>In the second chapter of his book on <i>Darwinism</i>, Dr. Alfred
Russel Wallace lays himself out to say all that can be said, and a
great deal that cannot reasonably be said, in extenuation of
God&rsquo;s plan. He owns that, &ldquo;to many persons, Nature appears
calm, orderly, and peaceful. They see the birds singing in the trees,
the insects hovering over the flowers, and all living things in the
possession of health and in the enjoyment of a sunny existence. But
they do not see, and hardly ever think of, the means by which this
beauty and harmony and enjoyment is brought about. They do not see the
constant and daily search after food, the failure to obtain which means
weakness or death; the constant effort to escape enemies; the
ever-recurring struggle against the forces of Nature. This daily and
hourly struggle, this incessant warfare, is, nevertheless, the very
means by which much of the beauty and harmony and enjoyment in Nature
is produced, and also affords one of the most important elements in
bringing about the origin of the species.&rdquo; After showing that the
struggle for existence has proved a stumbling-block in the way of those
who would fain believe in the all-wise and benevolent Ruler of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>universe, he goes on to say that &ldquo;all this
is greatly exaggerated&rdquo;; that &ldquo;the supposed torments and
miseries of animals have little real existence, but are the reflection
of the imagined sensations of cultivated men and women under similar
circumstances&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;the amount of actual suffering
caused by the struggle for existence among animals is altogether
insignificant.&rdquo; Space, and a consideration for a possibly
impatient reader, prevent my wading through the paltry reasons he
proceeds to bring forward in order to try to prove that pain is not
pain, and that the less degree of pain suffered by an animal or a
savage is an excuse for its infliction.</p>
<p>The Rev. Professor Flint&rsquo;s book on <i>Theism</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4214src" href="#xd21e4214" name=
"xd21e4214src">15</a> is much patronised by the Church as an apologetic
book of the highest order. The Professor tries to show (p. 204) that,
although the process of development involves privation, pain, and
conflict, it is subservient to the noblest end, because the final
result is, as he alleges, order and beauty. All the perfections of
sentient creatures are, he owns, due to this painful process.
&ldquo;Through it the lion has gained its strength, the deer its speed,
the dog its sagacity. The suffering which the conflict involves may
indicate that God has made even animals for some higher end than
happiness&mdash;that He cares for animals&rsquo; perfection as well as
for animals&rsquo; enjoyment. The ends are eminently worthy of a Divine
intelligence.&rdquo; The Professor does <i>not</i> explain why, to
paraphrase one of Mr. Lowes Dickenson&rsquo;s sage remarks, the less
perfectly evolved generations should be sacrificed in order that future
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>generations may be heirs of an unearned
increment. Myself, I fail to see that even the ends, whatever they may
happen to be&mdash;and they appear distinctly nebulous&mdash;can ever
justify the cruel means; and I feel sure that our dumb
fellow-creatures, the principal parties concerned, would agree with me,
had they the power of reflection and speech. How can they, how can we,
profess to approve of a plan that brings only unhappiness in its train?
Suppose it were necessary in order to give more happiness in an
after-life, the creature might meekly wonder why he or she had first to
suffer pain, but could imagine, as the pious imagine, that it must be
for some good purpose. Does Dr. Flint mean to say that there is an
after-life for all living things? The learned Professor tries to
explain pain away by describing its preservative use. He says (p. 246):
&ldquo;Were animals insusceptible of pain, they would be in continual
peril.&rdquo; That would certainly spoil the evolutionary
Creator&rsquo;s plans; but it hardly excuses His methods. Professor
Flint, however, argues that, though pain is not an end in itself, it is
a means to an end, and &ldquo;its end is a benevolent one.&rdquo; How,
I ask does it profit the creature itself to become ever so graceful in
appearance, ever so perfect in mind and body, if it is only to gratify
its Maker, who has an end in view with which it is in no wise itself
concerned, and to attain which infinite pain has to be endured? Which
would you or I rather be&mdash;lovely and unhappy, or ugly and
happy?</p>
<p>There is another of these attempts to relieve doubt which I should
like to bring to notice. The little book entitled <i>In Relief of
Doubt</i>, by the Rev. E. Welsh, highly recommended by the Bishop of
London, and one of the books selected by the Christian Evidence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>Society for their examination in March, 1907, is
quoted from by Dr. Warschauer<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4231src" href=
"#xd21e4231" name="xd21e4231src">16</a> when refuting Mr.
Blatchford&rsquo;s remarks on the cruelty of Nature. Dr. Warschauer
selects the passage where Mr. Welsh says (p. 103): &ldquo;We probably
overstate the actual anguish of the lower creatures, imagining that
they are bundles of sensitive nerves and quick brains like our own, and
that they therefore have our sensibility to pain. A trodden worm
writhes, and we credit it with all the pain that the foot of a
Brobdingnag would inflict on a delicate child under his heel.&rdquo;
Now, I am quite sure we credit no such thing. If we did, we, and
especially the Isaak Waltons among us, would be perfect monsters of
cruelty. Mark, too, how Messrs. Welsh and Warschauer carefully select
for their illustration a <i>worm</i>&mdash;one of the lowly organised
invertebrates! I may mention that Dr. Warschauer&rsquo;s book was
particularly recommended to me by a well-read cleric, who thought that
it was an admirable and complete refutation of Mr. Blatchford&rsquo;s
arguments. Dr. Warschauer will hardly advance his cause by
transparently omitting all mention of the higher animals, or of that
bundle of nerves called man.</p>
<p>Nor will the average man agree with Professor Wallace that
&ldquo;<i>it is difficult even to imagine a system by which a greater
balance of happiness could have been secured</i>.&rdquo; Was it, for
example, impossible for God to have decreed that sentient life should
feed only on non-sentient life? Could He not have brought about
development without all this terrible struggle? One would think that
Messrs. Warschauer and Wallace must not only have had a particularly
good time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>themselves in this world, but must have
purposely shut their eyes to the misery all round them. If they had to
change places with a wounded Russian or Japanese writhing in agony on
the battlefield, I wonder whether their optimism would stand the test?
The bravest of us shudder at the idea of being buried alive, and yet
this was just the very fate of many a poor fellow in that truly
terrible war. Not that <i>man</i> did not do his utmost. &ldquo;One by
one the dead and injured were carefully and tenderly taken out,&rdquo;
relates an eye-witness, &ldquo;and many a tear was shed by strong men
at the terrible sights we had to witness. The worst part of our work
was to have to endure the agonising cries of the men who were suffering
terrible torture; but everyone helped so willingly that we felt that we
were not doing enough.&rdquo; Please note, on the one hand, the cruel
torture, and, on the other, the sympathy of <i>man</i>.</p>
<p>I will not weary or distress you further, gentle reader, with
harrowing details of the pain that is endured alike by man and beast.
It is all so well known. I shall only ask you to listen to a little
story from the leaves of a naturalist&rsquo;s note-book, and to put to
yourself a few questions. &ldquo;A sparrow-hawk suddenly dashed under
the branches of a hedgerow oak, and seized a linnet. But the bird of
prey had not calculated upon the missel-thrush whose nest was in the
oak, and who made it his business to have no suspicious strangers
loitering in the neighbourhood. With an angry &lsquo;jarr,&rsquo; and a
swoop that would have done credit to the hawk himself, the plucky
missel-thrush was upon the marauder almost at the same instant that the
linnet was seized; a feather&mdash;a hawk&rsquo;s feather&mdash;floated
in the air, and the astonished bird of prey flung himself sideways, and
spread his talons to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"
name="pb188">188</a>]</span>meet the next assault. This action released
the linnet, who sped away into the next parish like a bullet, while the
missel-thrush, perched in the oak tree again, noisily threatened to
repeat the attack. So the sparrow-hawk departed in the opposite
direction to the linnet, and in two minutes all birddom was twittering
and squabbling as before on the site of what was so very nearly a
sudden tragedy.&rdquo; Is not your sympathy, humane reader, all with
the linnet and its gallant rescuer, although the hawk was but carrying
out the behests of its Maker! Does it not give us a thrill of pleasure
when the lion is baulked of his prey&mdash;when the pet lamb is rescued
from the butcher? Are we, then, more merciful than God? Was it Jesus or
was it the gentle Gautama that marked</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;How lizard fed on ant, and snake on him,</p>
<p class="line">And kite on both; and how the fish-hawk robbed</p>
<p class="line">The fish-tiger of that which it had seized;</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 3. <i>The Bible Account of Creation
Irreconcilable with Science in Each and Every Respect.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The hypothesis respecting the past history of Nature,
which was formerly, and is still very largely, accepted by Christians,
is the doctrine fully and clearly stated in the immortal poem of John
Milton&mdash;the English Divina Commedia&mdash;<i>Paradise Lost</i>.
There is the best of reasons for the popularity of this doctrine.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>It agrees literally with the plain words of the
Bible. The hypothesis is briefly this: &ldquo;That this visible
universe of ours came into existence at no great distance of time from
the present, and that the parts of which it is composed made their
appearance, in a certain definite order, in the space of six natural
days, in such a manner that on the first of these days light appeared;
that on the second the firmament or sky separated the waters above from
the waters beneath the firmament; that on the third day the waters drew
away from the dry land, and upon it a varied vegetable life, similar to
that which now exists, made its appearance; that the fourth day was
signalised by the apparition of the sun, the stars, the moon, and the
planets; that on the fifth day aquatic animals originated within the
waters; that on the sixth day the earth gave rise to our four-footed
terrestrial creatures, and to all variations of terrestrial animals
except birds, which had appeared on the preceding day; and, finally,
that man appeared upon the earth, and the emergence of the universe
from chaos was finished.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4299src"
href="#xd21e4299" name="xd21e4299src">18</a> This interpretation is
that which has been instilled into most of us in our childhood; but,
&ldquo;if we are to listen to many expositors of no mean authority, we
must believe that what seems so clearly defined in Genesis&mdash;as if
very great pains had been taken that there should be no possibility of
mistake&mdash;is not the meaning of the text at all. The account is
divided into periods that we may make just as long or as short as
convenience requires. We are also to understand that it is consistent
with the original text to believe that the most complex plants and
animals may have been evolved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"
href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>by natural processes, lasting
for millions of years, out of structureless rudiments. A person who is
not a Hebrew scholar can only stand aside and admire the marvellous
flexibility of a language which admits of such diverse
interpretations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4307src" href=
"#xd21e4307" name="xd21e4307src">19</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, we are to understand that there is no disagreement
between theology and science in the <i>sequence</i> of the six acts of
creation. Here at least we are not asked to twist words round so that
one may mean a million. We have a definite statement which science
either supports or it does not. The reader who knows that the verdict
of science is negative may ask: &ldquo;What is the use of wasting my
time over a Christian argument which has long since been
exploded?&rdquo; I crave his pardon and patience; but, however true it
may be that Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s position was shown to be untenable,
it is equally true that an enormous number of persons still persist in
maintaining that there is a remarkable coincidence of the Pentateuchal
story with the result of modern investigation, and that science
supports them in this conclusion. The Very Rev. Henry Wace, D.D., Dean
of Canterbury, in his address before the Christian Association of
University College, London, on May 7th, 1903, reminded his hearers that
a President of the British Association (Sir William Dawson) had stated
that &ldquo;it would not be easy even now to construct a statement of
the development of the world in popular terms so concise and so
accurate&rdquo; as the first chapter of Genesis. And Dr. Wace asks:
&ldquo;From whence could have come this marvellous approximation, to
say the least, to the facts which science has been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>slowly revealing but from the Divine wisdom
which alone was cognizant of them, and could alone make them known to
mankind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time ago a lady very kindly sent me a little pamphlet,
entitled <i>Roger&rsquo;s Reasons; or, The Bible and Science</i>,
written by the Rev. John Urquhart. In this there is a resurrection pie
of the old, old arguments, dished up again in such a guise as to take
in the unwary and ill-informed, who would have no suspicion that the
food thus given them for their refection was not only stale, but had
been condemned as unfit for mental consumption by the whole of the
scientific faculty. The lady above mentioned considered the reasoning
perfectly convincing, and so possibly would ninety-nine Christian
ladies out of a hundred. Mr. Urquhart is now much in evidence as a
Christian apologist, and his pamphlet is being distributed broadcast
(81,000 have already been issued), so that it does seem worth while
taking some notice of the attempts that are still being made to treat
the Creation myth as a Divine revelation. That modern science does not
support either the interpretation put upon the Bible story of the
Creation by Mr. Urquhart or by Mr. Gladstone, or any interpretation
which is compatible with the general sense of the narrative, can be
ascertained by anyone who will read Professor Huxley&rsquo;s essays,
&ldquo;The Interpreters of Genesis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Gladstone and
Genesis.&rdquo; A few quotations from these essays may enable the
reader to form a slight idea of the decisive manner in which the
assertion that modern science supports the Bible narrative is
controverted by science herself.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s contention that the statements in
the first two verses of Genesis are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>supported by the
nebular hypothesis, Professor Huxley remarks: &ldquo;But science knows
nothing of any stage in which the universe could be said, in other than
a metaphorical and popular sense, to be formless or empty; or in any
respect less the seat of law and order than it is now. One might as
well talk of a fresh-laid hen&rsquo;s egg being &lsquo;without form and
void&rsquo; because the chick therein is potential and not actual, as
apply such terms to the nebulous mass which contains a potential solar
system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note at the end of the second essay, &ldquo;Mr. Gladstone and
Genesis,&rdquo; there is an excellent exposition of the &ldquo;Proper
Sense of the &lsquo;Mosaic&rsquo; Narrative of the Creation.&rdquo;
Among other points, Huxley, of course, notices how the stars are, as it
were, thrown in&mdash;&ldquo;He made the stars also.&rdquo; These words
have always struck me as making it peculiarly clear that the
&ldquo;Mosaic&rdquo; narrative originated from man, and not from God.
The unknown authors of the Hexateuchal compilation were almost as
ignorant of the nature of the stars and of their unthinkable distance
away from us as a camel-driver in Sind, who gravely informed a friend
of mine that the stars were once quite close to the earth, until one
fine day a certain woman (it is always the <i>woman</i> who causes the
mischief) grabbed hold of one and used it for cleaning her child,
whereupon the gods, much annoyed at such presumption on the part of
mankind, moved them far enough off to be safe from further
desecration.</p>
<p>That the order of Creation as given in the Bible cannot be
maintained will be clearly seen if we take the particular case of the
birds and creeping things. Science does not affirm that the birds were
made before &ldquo;everything that creepeth upon the earth.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>Mr. Gladstone tries to get over the difficulty
by excluding reptiles, lizards, etc., from the category of creeping
things. This will appear in the course of the following quotations from
Professor Huxley&rsquo;s essay on &ldquo;Mr. Gladstone and
Genesis&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s views as to the proper method of
dealing with grave and difficult scientific and religious problems had
permitted him to base a solemn &lsquo;plea for a revelation of truth
from God&rsquo; upon an error as to a matter of fact, from which the
intelligent perusal of a manual of pal&aelig;ontology would have saved
him.... He does, indeed, make a great parade of authorities, and I have
the greatest respect for those authorities whom Mr. Gladstone mentions.
If he will get them to sign a joint memorial to the effect that our
present pal&aelig;ontological evidence proves that birds appeared
before the &lsquo;land population&rsquo; of terrestrial reptiles, I
shall think it my duty to reconsider my position&mdash;but not till
then.... I have every respect for the singer of the Song of the Three
Children (whoever he may have been); I desire to cast no shadow of
doubt upon, but, on the contrary, marvel at, the exactness of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s information as to the considerations which
&lsquo;affected the method of the Mosaic writer&rsquo;; nor do I
venture to doubt that the inconvenient intrusion of these contemptible
reptiles&mdash;&lsquo;a family fallen from greatness,&rsquo; a
miserable, decayed aristocracy reduced to mere &lsquo;skulkers about
the earth,&rsquo; in consequence, apparently, of difficulties about the
occupation of land arising out of the earth-hunger of their former
serfs, the mammals&mdash;into an apologetic argument, which would
otherwise run quite smoothly, is in every way to be deprecated. Still,
the wretched creatures stand there, importunately demanding notice;
and, however different may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>be the practice in that
contentious atmosphere with which Mr. Gladstone expresses and laments
his familiarity, in the atmosphere of science it really is of no avail
whatever to shut one&rsquo;s eyes to facts, or to try and bury them out
of sight under a tumulus of rhetoric.... However reprehensible, and,
indeed, contemptible, terrestrial reptiles may be, the only question
which appears to me to be relevant to my argument is whether these
creatures are or are not comprised under the denomination of
&lsquo;everything that creepeth upon the ground.&rsquo;... Hence I
commend the following extract from the eleventh chapter of Leviticus to
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s serious attention:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">And these are they which are unclean unto you among
the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the
mouse, and the great lizard after its kind, and the gecko, and the
land-crocodile, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon. These are they
which are unclean to you among all that creep (v. 29&ndash;31).</p>
</div>
<p>The merest Sunday-school exegesis, therefore, suffices to prove
that, when the Mosaic writer in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%201:24">Genesis 1.
24</a> speaks of &lsquo;creeping things,&rsquo; he means to include
lizards among them. This being so, it is agreed on all hands that
terrestrial lizards and other reptiles allied to lizards occur in the
Permian strata. It is further agreed that the Triassic strata were
deposited after these. Moreover, it is well known that, even if certain
footprints are to be taken as unquestionable evidence of the existence
of birds, they are not known to occur in rocks earlier than the Trias,
while indubitable remains of birds are not to be met with till much
later. Hence it follows that natural science does not
&lsquo;affirm&rsquo; the statement that birds were made on the fifth
day, and &lsquo;everything that creepeth on the ground&rsquo; on the
sixth, on which Mr. Gladstone rests his order; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>for,
as is shown by Leviticus, the &lsquo;Mosaic writer&rsquo; includes
lizards among his creeping things.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4353src" href="#xd21e4353" name="xd21e4353src">20</a></p>
<p>The crust of the earth is a book having for its pages strata that
have, fortunately, been upturned for our perusal, and the story it
tells must be true. The series of fossiliferous deposits which contain
the remains of the animals which have lived on the earth in past ages
of its history afford the evidence required concerning the order of
appearance of the different species. As Professor Huxley says
elsewhere<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4360src" href="#xd21e4360" name=
"xd21e4360src">21</a>: &ldquo;When we consider these simple facts, we
see how absolutely futile are the attempts that have been made to draw
a parallel between the story told by so much of the crust of the earth
as is known to us and the story which Milton tells.&rdquo; Still, the
story which Milton tells is in accord with the story which the Bible
tells to those who are not given to playing conjuring tricks with the
plain meaning of words.</p>
<p>Finally, we must remember that &ldquo;hundreds of thousands of
animal species, as distinct as those which now compose our water, land,
and air populations, have come into existence and died out
again.&rdquo; &ldquo;If the species of animals have all been separately
created, then it follows that hundreds of thousands of acts of creative
energy have occurred, at intervals throughout the whole time recorded
by the fossiliferous rocks; and, during the greater part of that time,
the &lsquo;creation&rsquo; of the members of the water, land, and air
populations must have gone on contemporaneously.&rdquo;<a class=

"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>The common-sense view of the Creation story, and one that is now
widely accepted even by orthodox Christians, is that it is a myth. Many
of us will, therefore, agree with Professor Huxley when he says:
&ldquo;I suppose it to be an hypothesis respecting the origin of the
universe which some ancient thinker found himself able to reconcile
with his knowledge, or what he thought was knowledge, of the nature of
things, and therefore assumed to be true. As such, I hold it to be not
merely an interesting, but a venerable, monument of a stage in the
mental progress of mankind; and I find it difficult to suppose that any
one who is acquainted with the cosmogonies of other nations&mdash;and
especially with those of the Egyptians and the Babylonians, with whom
the Israelites were in such frequent and intimate
communication&mdash;should consider it to possess either more or less
scientific importance than may be allotted to these.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>It may not be inappropriate to conclude this section with
Milton&rsquo;s conception of the last act of creation, so charmingly
simple and so strictly according to the Bible and what Christ Himself
believed, and yet so completely untrue:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The third and last of the Evolution stumbling-blocks
is that connected with the dogma of the Fall and Atonement. Before
considering this, it will be better, I think, to summarise as briefly
and simply as possible some of the chief proofs of our animal origin.
The well-informed can skip this section, which is intended for the
benefit of that vast majority&mdash;the ill-informed. Space will not
permit me to do much more than allude to the proofs; but anyone really
desirous of convincing himself or herself of the truth of the doctrine,
and at the same time wishing to avoid details that might possibly prove
wearisome, will find it popularly treated in Huxley&rsquo;s work on
<i>Man&rsquo;s Place in Nature</i> (Macmillan); in Dennis Hird&rsquo;s
<i>An Easy Outline of Evolution</i> (Watts &amp; Co.; 2s. 6d.); in
Edward Clodd&rsquo;s <i>The Story of Creation</i> (Watts &amp; Co.;
6d.); in S. Laing&rsquo;s <i>Modern Science and Modern Thought</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>(Watts &amp; Co.; 6d.); in Haeckel&rsquo;s
<i>Riddle of the Universe</i> (Watts &amp; Co.; 6d.), though this can
hardly, perhaps, be described as popular; and in Metchnikoff&rsquo;s
<i>The Nature of Man</i> (Heinemann, 1903; 12s. 6d.). The most complete
work on the subject is Haeckel&rsquo;s <i>The Evolution of Man</i>
(Watts &amp; Co., 1905; 42s.; abridged edition, 2s.). This is in two
volumes, copiously illustrated, of which the first is entirely devoted
to human embryology or ontogeny, a branch of science which furnishes
the most overwhelming evidence.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The proofs may, roughly speaking, be grouped under three
heads&mdash;the extraordinary affinity of bodily structure, the
revelations of embryology, and the tale told by the useless rudimentary
organs. We will commence with</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch5.4.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE EXTRAORDINARY AFFINITY OF BODILY STRUCTURE.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is notorious that man is constructed on the
same general type or model with other mammals. All the bones in his
skeleton can be compared with corresponding bones in a monkey, bat, or
seal. So it is with his muscles, nerves, blood-vessels, and viscera.
The brain, the most important of all the organs, follows the same law,
as shown by Huxley and other anatomists.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4491src" href="#xd21e4491" name="xd21e4491src">24</a> Man&rsquo;s
nearest animal relations are the tailless anthropoid or man-like
apes&mdash;namely, the gorilla, the chimpanzee, the orang, and the
gibbon. &ldquo;Now that all the details of the human organisation have
been studied, and the anatomical structures of man and large monkeys
without tails have been compared, bone with bone, and muscle with
muscle, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>truly astonishing analogy between these
organisms is made manifest&mdash;an analogy apparent in every
detail.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4498src" href="#xd21e4498"
name="xd21e4498src">25</a> The following are some of the points more
particularly calling for notice:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Dentition.</i>&mdash;In the natural history of mammals the teeth
play an important part as a means of determining differences and
relationships. &ldquo;Everyone knows the <i>milk teeth</i> and the
<i>permanent teeth</i> of man. The anthropoid apes bear in this respect
an <span class="corr" id="xd21e4513" title=
"Source: antonishing">astonishing</span> likeness to man. The number
(thirty-two in the adult), the form and general arrangement of the
crown, are identical in man and anthropoid apes. The differences are to
be found only in minor details.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4516src" href="#xd21e4516" name="xd21e4516src">26</a> &ldquo;But
the fact must not be lost sight of that all these differences are less
pronounced than those which exist between the dentition of anthropoid
apes and that of all other monkeys.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4521src" href="#xd21e4521" name="xd21e4521src">27</a></p>
<p><i>The Foot.</i>&mdash;Anti-evolutionists have laid great stress on
the difference between the foot of a man and that of an anthropoid ape.
But it is clearly shown by Huxley that in all essential respects the
hinder limb of the gorilla terminates in as true a foot as that of
man,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4530src" href="#xd21e4530" name=
"xd21e4530src">28</a> and &ldquo;that, be the differences between the
hand and foot of man and those of the gorilla what they may, the
differences between those of the gorilla and those of the lower apes
are much greater.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4535src" href=
"#xd21e4535" name="xd21e4535src">29</a></p>
<p><i>The Sacrum.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;In monkeys, as a whole, the sacrum
is composed of three, or rarely four, vertebr&aelig;, while in
anthropoid apes it contains five&mdash;that is to say, just as many as
in man.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4544src" href="#xd21e4544"
name="xd21e4544src">30</a></p>
<p><i>The Skull.</i>&mdash;Here the differences are more marked;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>but again we must remind ourselves that, as
regards the osteology, Professor Huxley tells us that &ldquo;for the
skull, no less than for the skeleton in general, the proposition holds
good that the differences between man and the gorilla are of smaller
value than those between the gorilla and some other
apes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4555src" href="#xd21e4555"
name="xd21e4555src">31</a></p>
<p><i>The Brain.</i>&mdash;Several distinguished zoologists at one time
insisted on the absence in all monkeys of certain parts of the brain
peculiarly characteristic of man, but now it is unanimously accepted
that the parts of the brain in question are &ldquo;precisely those
structures which are the most marked cerebral characters common to man
with the apes. They are among the most distinctly simian peculiarities
which the human organism exhibits.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4564src" href="#xd21e4564" name="xd21e4564src">32</a></p>
<p>The difference between the brain of the orang and that of man is a
mere difference of degree, and not of kind; and most students of
comparative psychology now admit that the intellectual faculties of
animals differ from those in man in degree only, not in their essence.
Replying to his opponents, Professor Huxley compares the brain of man
and that of ape with two watches, one of which will, and the other will
not, keep accurate time. He exclaims: &ldquo;A hair in the
balance-wheel, a little rust on a pinion, a bend in a tooth of the
escapement, a something so slight that only the practised eye of the
watchmaker can discover it, may be the source of all the
difference.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4571src" href=
"#xd21e4571" name="xd21e4571src">33</a></p>
<p>The late Sir Charles Lyell mentions in his <i>Antiquity of Man</i>
how Dr. Sumner, the late Archbishop of Canterbury, brought out in
strong relief fifty years ago, in his <i>Records of Creation</i>, one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>essential character separating man from the
brute. As the same argument is still being &ldquo;brought out,&rdquo;
and is, on the face of it, exceedingly plausible, and as the answer to
it has to do with the brain, it cannot be passed over. Dr. Sumner said:
&ldquo;It has been sometimes alleged, and may be founded on fact, that
there is less difference between the highest brute animal and the
lowest savage than between the savage and the most improved man. But,
in order to warrant the pretended analogy, it ought to be also true
that this lowest savage is no more capable of improvement than the
chimpanzee or orang-outang.&rdquo; This objection is met by some such
consideration as the following:&mdash;When you examine the enormous
difference in the formation of the skull in man and ape (look, for
instance, at plate xvii., vol. ii. of Haeckel&rsquo;s <i>Evolution of
Man</i>), and when you remember that this sets hard at an early date,
you surely have a good reason for limited improvability. Further, the
brain of even the lowest savage represents a development of some half a
million years above the ape along the line of intelligence. How, then,
can we dream of making this up in one or a few generations by
artificial training of the ape? Lastly, we have the enormous leverage
of language, the inherited wealth of thousands of speaking generations,
and an incalculable aid to thought. How much is the intelligence of the
Microcephal&aelig;, the clucking &ldquo;small heads&rdquo; lately on
show at the Hippodrome, capable of rapid improvement? Our experiments
do not show that the ape is not improvable, but only that we cannot, in
a single generation, lift it over a gulf representing 500,000 years of
human development. How can we expect it?</p>
<p><i>The Blood.</i>&mdash;In the last few years an astonishing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>confirmation of our relationship to the
anthropoid ape has been discovered. We are <i>blood relations</i>. Elie
Metchnikoff, Professor at the Pasteur Institute, shows this clearly in
his book, <i>The Nature of Man</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4604src"
href="#xd21e4604" name="xd21e4604src">34</a> Until quite recently it
was not known how to distinguish human blood from that of other
mammals. A method giving conclusive results has now been discovered,
and is used in forensic medicine. The same method has been employed in
comparing the blood of man and the anthropoid apes, resulting in the
discovery<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4610src" href="#xd21e4610" name=
"xd21e4610src">35</a> that, in their case, there is practically no
blood difference whatever!</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch5.4.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE REVELATIONS OF EMBRYOLOGY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The opponents of Evolution used to appeal to the
special features of human embryology, which were supposed to
distinguish man from all the other mammals; but in 1890 Emil Selenka
proved that the same features are found in anthropoid apes, especially
in the orang, while the lower apes are without them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Huxley wrote, the embryological history of anthropoid
apes was practically unknown. Darwin, Vogt, and Haeckel, in their
attempts to support the theory of the animal origin of man, had not
sufficient knowledge of the embryology of monkeys. It is only recently
that important work on this subject has been published.... The placenta
often gives information of great importance in the classification of
mammals. It is sufficient to glance at the zonary placenta of dogs and
seals to be convinced of the relationship of these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>two
species which at first sight seem so different. Now, the placentas of
all the anthropoid apes examined up to the present are of the same
discoid type as that of man. The arrangement of the umbilical cord of
man, which was formerly considered as quite peculiar to him, is found
in anthropoid apes, as has been established by Deniker and Selenka. It
is striking that the anthropoids resemble man rather than the lower
monkeys in the relation of the f&oelig;tus to the f&oelig;tal
membranes. With regard to the embryos themselves, the similarity
between those of monkeys and man is very great.... The youngest stages
of human development that have been obtained can hardly be
distinguished from those of the lower monkeys either in position or
shape. More advanced stages exhibit greater differentiation, and the
later embryos of man resemble those of anthropoids much more closely
than those of the lower monkeys. The resemblance between the nearly
mature f&oelig;tus of anthropoids and human embryos of about the sixth
month is evident enough.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4625src"
href="#xd21e4625" name="xd21e4625src">36</a></p>
<p>We are thus bound, in all honesty, to own up to our ape-like
progenitors. But this is only a small portion of the wonderful tale
told by Embryology. &ldquo;Man is developed from an ovule about 125th
of an inch in diameter, which differs in no respect from the ovules of
other animals,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4632src" href=
"#xd21e4632" name="xd21e4632src">37</a> and, marvellous to relate, from
that stage upwards the embryo is one continuous epitome of the history
of man&rsquo;s evolution from lower forms of life.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4637src" href="#xd21e4637" name="xd21e4637src">38</a> Up to a
certain point the germs, not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>only of all mammals, but of all
vertebrate animals, fishes, reptiles, and birds, are scarcely
distinguishable. A sceptic may convince himself by studying the plates
given in Haeckel&rsquo;s <i>The Evolution of Man</i>, and especially
plates ix. to xiv., where the embryos of various animals are compared.
At the more advanced stage, where the embryo has already passed the
reptilian form, we find that for a considerable time the line of
development remains the same as that of other mammalia. The
resemblance, for example, after the first four weeks&rsquo; growth,
between the embryo of a man and that of a dog is such that it is
scarcely possible to distinguish the one from the other. Even at the
age of eight weeks the embryo man is an animal with a tail, hardly to
be distinguished from an embryo puppy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4645src" href="#xd21e4645" name="xd21e4645src">39</a> After this
period the embryo emerges from the general mammalian type into the
special order of primates to which man belongs. Thus does the growth of
the egg from which man springs compress into a few weeks the results of
millions of years, and set before us the history of his development
from fish-like and reptilian forms (which, as we have seen, p. 211, Mr.
Gladstone deemed so contemptible and &ldquo;fallen from
greatness&rdquo;), and of his more immediate descent from a hairy,
tailed quadruped, the extinct common ancestor of man and monkey. As
evolution proceeds the embryo rises up to man, and the differences
specialising the human infant at its birth, such as the largeness and
more complex convolutions of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>brain, become more and more
accentuated as its growth proceeds.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of &ldquo;gaps,&rdquo; we have to bear in
mind that it is part of the evolutionary theory that the active
processes of evolution have very largely ceased, that existing forms
are but a surviving remnant with enormous gaps, and that the survivors
are so fitted at present to their surroundings that evolutionary forces
are causative of equilibrium rather than change. We have already seen,
too, that in the struggle for existence it is among the closely-allied
species that the contest is more strenuous, and that the weakest, or
least fitted to survive, has to go to the wall&mdash;to be wiped out.
Thus it is that there is a tendency for species to become extinct, and
for the gaps to be widened. The extraordinary thing is not that we have
so little direct evidence of descent, but that we have so much. That
there are not more links missing is due principally to the discovery of
fossil remains. When an animal dies, the probabilities are, of course,
enormously against geological preservation of its bones, yet the gaps
are continually being filled up by geological finds, and, though the
remaining gaps may be great, they are not unaccountable.</p>
<p>I must now pass on to the remaining set of proofs of our origin.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch5.4.3">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE TALE TOLD BY THE USELESS RUDIMENTARY ORGANS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Perhaps nothing furnishes a more conclusive proof of
our animal origin than the study of rudimentary
structures&mdash;muscles, sense-organs, hair, bones, reproductive
organs, etc. There are some which are &ldquo;either absolutely useless,
such as the mamm&aelig; of the male quadrupeds or the incisor teeth of
ruminants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>which never cut through the gums; or they are of
such slight service to their present possessors that we cannot suppose
that they were developed under the conditions which now
exist.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4668src" href="#xd21e4668"
name="xd21e4668src">40</a> Of useless rudimentary organs, or parts of
organs, there are not less than one hundred and seven in man.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4673src" href="#xd21e4673" name=
"xd21e4673src">41</a> To this category belong the coccyx&mdash;the
vestige of a tail&mdash;the muscles of the ear, the vermiform
appendage, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>os coccyx</i> in man, though functionless as a tail,
plainly represents this part in other vertebrate animals. At an early
embryonic period it is free, and, as we have seen, projects beyond the
lower extremities.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4684src" href=
"#xd21e4684" name="xd21e4684src">42</a> It sometimes happens that we
find external relics of a tail. Professor Haeckel, in Fig. 195, vol. i.
of <i>The Evolution of Man</i> (library edition), shows the tail of a
six months&rsquo; old boy, which Granville Harrison removed by
operation. The anthropoid ape, like man, has only the rudiment of a
tail.</p>
<p>The <i>ear muscles</i> are rudimentary in man. &ldquo;It is well
known how readily domestic animals&mdash;horses, cows, dogs, hares,
etc.&mdash;point their ears and move them in different directions. Most
of the apes do the same, and our earlier ape ancestors were also able
to do it. But our later simian ancestors, which we have in common with
the anthropoid apes, abandoned the use of these muscles, and they
gradually became rudimentary and useless. However, we possess them
still. In fact, some men can still move their ears a little backward
and forward by means of the drawing and withdrawing muscles; and with
practice this faculty can be much improved. But no man can now
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>lift up his ears by the raising muscle, or
change the shape of them by the small inner muscles. These muscles were
very useful to our ancestors, but are of no consequence to us. This
applies to most of the anthropoid apes as well.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4699src" href="#xd21e4699" name=
"xd21e4699src">43</a></p>
<p>The <i>vermiform appendage</i> of the c&oelig;cum is not only
practically useless, but the source of that extremely dangerous
complaint, appendicitis. It is remarkable that this organ is
practically identical with the vermiform appendage of anthropoid apes,
yet none of the other monkeys present any such resemblance with men.
Professor Haeckel, speaking of the vermiform appendage, says:
&ldquo;The only significance of it in man is that not infrequently a
cherry-stone or some other hard and indigestible matter penetrates into
its narrow cavity, and by setting up inflammation and suppuration
causes the death of otherwise sound men. Teleology has great difficulty
in giving a rational explanation of, and attributing to a beneficent
Providence, this dreaded appendicitis. In our plant-eating ancestors
this rudimentary organ was much larger, and had a useful
function.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4709src" href="#xd21e4709"
name="xd21e4709src">44</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to understand the existence of rudimentary organs,
we have only to suppose that a former progenitor possessed the parts in
question in a perfect state, and that under changed habits of life they
became greatly reduced, either from simple disuse or through the
natural selection of those individuals which were least encumbered with
a superfluous part, aided by the other means previously
indicated.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4716src" href="#xd21e4716"
name="xd21e4716src">45</a></p>
<p>Whatever the precise explanation may be, can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>we
bring ourselves to suppose that God created us with a number of useless
organs, or that He placed them there as a snare to entrap our judgment?
Again, &ldquo;rudimentary organs, for the most part, display a
congenital lack of the power of resistance, and, as Darwin suggested,
for this reason they are frequently the seats of
disease.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4725src" href="#xd21e4725"
name="xd21e4725src">46</a> Can anyone imagine his Maker arranging all
this on purpose? I can not. We are assured by pious apologists that God
has instituted pain in order to save us from injuring ourselves; how
can He, then, have specially provided us with organs whose only
function is to be a source of danger?</p>
<p>Many other examples might be given bearing on this line of argument;
but enough has been said, I hope, to convince the reader that in these
rudimentary organs there is overpowering evidence against separate acts
of creation, and in favour of an animal origin of the human race.
Besides this, we have also the evidence derived from the study of our
bodily structure and embryonic development. The bearing of these three
great classes of fact is, as Charles Darwin remarks, unmistakeable.
&ldquo;It is only our natural prejudice, and that arrogance which made
our own forefathers declare that they were descended from demi-gods,
which lead us to demur to this conclusion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h4 class="main">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE QUESTION.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No Biblical standpoint is more directly opposed to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>modern evolutionary views than the doctrine of
the Fall and Atonement. We have seen, in the chapters on the Higher
Criticism and on Comparative Mythology, that the Bible story of
Creation is nothing but a borrowed legend; and we have now seen that it
could not in any case be true. If it were, Evolution would be untrue.
Now, the account of the fall of man is an exceedingly important portion
of the Bible, the whole fabric of the Christian faith being constructed
upon it; and there is no doubt whatever that the average Christian
realises this, and continues to believe in the &ldquo;Fall.&rdquo; He
may accept the doctrine of the evolution of the physical nature of man;
but he flatly denies that his intellect and moral attributes were a
part of the process, although such authorities as Darwin, Huxley, and
Romanes clearly point out that man&rsquo;s intellect and moral sense
have arisen from lower stages of the same faculties in his primate
ancestors.</p>
<p>The conservative Christian believes that man was originally endowed
with a lofty moral nature; that he succumbed to temptation; that he
became a degraded being; that he has been working out his punishment
ever since; and that his hope of escape from the curse laid upon all
mankind lies in the atonement made by Jesus Christ. Even if inclined to
have views less strictly in accord with the Christian teaching of the
past eighteen hundred years, he still believes that all this is true in
some sort of allegorical sense which cannot be exactly defined. Lastly,
there is an ever-swelling host of perplexed Christians who, in their
heart of hearts, feel much as Mr. Blatchford does when he says:
&ldquo;God is all-powerful. He could have made Adam strong enough to
resist Eve. He could have made Eve strong enough to resist the serpent.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>He need not have made the serpent at all. God is
all-knowing. Therefore, when He made Adam and Eve and the serpent He
knew that Adam and Eve <i>must</i> fall. And if God knew they
<i>must</i> fall, how could Adam help falling, and how could he justly
be blamed for doing what he <i>must</i> do? God made a
bridge&mdash;built it Himself, of His own materials, to His own design,
and knew what the bearing strain of the bridge was. If, then, God put
upon the bridge a weight equal to double the bearing strain, how could
God justly blame the bridge for falling?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4762src" href="#xd21e4762" name="xd21e4762src">48</a></p>
<p>The average divine, whatever his denomination, is usually in no
hurry to accept Evolutionist theories of the Fall, or, if he does, he
keeps it to himself. Dean Wace thinks the tale of Eden and the Fall is
partly historical, partly allegorical, and, in any case, true to
Christian experience; and Cardinal Newman considered that the whole
orthodox Christian scheme stood or fell with a belief in some great
&ldquo;aboriginal catastrophe.&rdquo; Progressive divines teach, on the
contrary, that the narrative of the Fall is not to be understood as
literal history, any more than the visions of the Apocalypse are to be
understood as a literal description of heaven. &ldquo;For us,&rdquo;
they say, &ldquo;the underlying truth, and not the outward form in
which that truth is clothed, is the essential thing.&rdquo; [As our
first parents are represented as being in a state of guileless
simplicity, and subsequently falling in with the tempting serpent, who,
in obvious contrast with their untried innocence, is described as a
being of special subtilty, the &ldquo;underlying truth&rdquo; appears
to be that, with God&rsquo;s cognisance, man is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>continually being taken advantage of by a crafty
spirit of evil; or, to keep more closely to the religious
evolutionist&rsquo;s idea, man&rsquo;s better nature, implanted by God,
is being continually got the better of by animal instincts implanted by
&mdash;&mdash;?] These enlightened clerics are in a somewhat delicate
position, and none probably recognise this more than they do
themselves, as testified lately by the fact of over a hundred of their
number distributing a manifesto to all the clergy of the Church of
England, in which they express a desire to receive authoritative
encouragement to face critical problems with entire candour.<a class=

<h4 class="main">AN INSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The gravity of the situation and the divergence of the
new from the old teaching are summed up by the <i>Church Times</i> in
the following pertinent remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;It is impossible for
Christians to affect nonchalance as to the result of the controversy
between anthropologists like Lubbock, Lyell, Huxley, Haeckel, and
Fiske, who assert the human race to have continuously (with whatever
relapses) progressed out of brutish and squalid barbarism, and those
who, like the late Duke of Argyll, Lang, Tylor, Hartmann,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4785src" href="#xd21e4785" name=
"xd21e4785src">50</a> Renouf, and most missionaries, maintain that
savagery is a declension from higher things, and that
&lsquo;man&rsquo;s natural state is civilisation&rsquo;&mdash;not, of
course, the civilisation of Paris and London, of trousers and
half-penny papers, nor yet Rousseau&rsquo;s anarchic golden
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>age, but creation in God&rsquo;s image after His
likeness. It is said that we need believe no more about our first
parents than that they were innocent&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, had not yet
made trial of good and evil; that the &lsquo;former Adam,&rsquo; even
after he had ceased to be a pithecoid hanging by his tail from boughs,
and long after his mollusc<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4793src" href=
"#xd21e4793" name="xd21e4793src">51</a> stage of existence, was still
as <i>primus homo</i>, a demi-witted creature, burrowing in holes,
gnawing roots, grunting, grimacing, snarling, shuddering; not even a
noble savage, but bestial and grovelling. As moral consciousness slowly
woke in him, he misused his powers; but such a &lsquo;fall&rsquo; was
really an advance. Such is the latest version of Paradise lost&mdash;of
that great disinheritance, that moral and spiritual catastrophe, which,
St. Paul avers, was the entrance of death into the world by one man,
and which, he seems to say, dragged down the lower creation when the
son of God, &lsquo;paragon of animals, noble in reason, infinite in
faculty,&rsquo; fell in Eden. We do not urge that the two teachings
cannot be reconciled; but it is clear that the immense difficulty is
not to be dismissed by saying that the Bible is a mosaic, not Mosaic,
or that it does not profess to instruct us in
anthropology.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4800src" href=
"#xd21e4800" name="xd21e4800src">52</a></p>
<p>There is a downrightness and lucidity about this criticism of
advanced theology which one cannot but admire, although one may not be
able to share its optimism as to the chance of the two teachings ever
becoming reconciled. How can they? Consider the unsatisfactory nature
of the following speculations by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213"
href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>means of which the clerical
evolutionist hopes to surmount the stumbling-block of the Fall.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch5.5.3">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE BISHOP OF WORCESTER&rsquo;S THEORY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dr. Gore, Bishop of Worcester, now of Birmingham, who
is an adherent of Evolution, speaks mysteriously of a &ldquo;fall from
without.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4818src" href="#xd21e4818"
name="xd21e4818src">53</a> As the question is of enormous importance to
the truth of Christianity, I propose to examine Dr. Gore&rsquo;s thesis
at some length. He grants that the idea of special creation is
inconceivable, and that our race has an animal ancestry, and then gives
us the following description of primeval man, which (shades of our
forefathers!) he assures us is according to the Bible and the
enlightened ideas of early Christianity: &ldquo;Man began at the
bottom, immature, in the fullest sense of immaturity, totally
undeveloped, but with a capacity for development.&rdquo; A
correspondent of Dr. Gore&rsquo;s, anxious possibly to be let down
gently in the matter of his ancestor, suggested &ldquo;immature, but
not deformed.&rdquo; This Dr. Gore accepted as a good phrase. Most of
us would think that when our ancestor was at the stage, say, of the
ape-like man he would be deformed according to existing notions of the
human form divine, while, if only at the protoplasm stage, the question
of form would hardly matter.</p>
<p>It has been explained to me by a clerical biologist that the Bishop
meant that the Fall was not a fall from a completely developed form to
one less developed, but that there was perversion of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>development, so that a rudimentary life which
might have been developed one way has developed along a less favourable
path&mdash;a common occurrence in ontogeny. However that may be, and
whatever the physical or mental state of this creature at the time he
&ldquo;fell,&rdquo; was his previous state one of beautiful innocence
and purity? What about those inherited animal instincts? Dr. Gore goes
on to say that &ldquo;humanity might have, with infinitely more
rapidity, developed upward; it has been delayed, retarded by
sin.&rdquo; Granted; but at what stage of development did this poor
wretch ever get a proper chance? The Christian faith inculcates that
there is no chance for him without belief. What belief did this
immature man have to guide him?</p>
<p>However, let us see what more Dr. Gore may have to tell us on the
Fall and Atonement. The words already quoted are from his second
lecture to the Birmingham working men. In his third and last lecture he
says: &ldquo;He (God) appointed that man alone of creatures should have
a twofold nature&mdash;that he should have fellowship with physical
nature, but also that he should have fellowship with God. He (man) fell
through a suggestion from without, and preferred wilfulness to
obedience; he thus fell into sin, and sin, when it is finished,
bringeth forth death. Note that, if sin is said to have caused death,
Christ is said to have abolished death. &lsquo;He that believeth on Me
shall never die.&rsquo; It is death as men have known it, the end of
their hopes, that sin introduced and Christ abolished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, is the Bishop&rsquo;s answer regarding the
&ldquo;Fall&rdquo; question. There has been a &ldquo;fall through a
suggestion from <i>without</i>,&rdquo; whatever that may happen to
mean. I should have thought that, if there was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>fall
at all, it was through a suggestion from <i>within</i>, much as Canon
Wilson puts it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4840src" href="#xd21e4840"
name="xd21e4840src">54</a> Bishop Gore, however, probably feels that it
has to be from <i>without</i> to agree with the Bible story of the
temptation. We are told nothing further about this mysterious
&ldquo;without,&rdquo; and I ask: &ldquo;Could anything be more vague
and unsatisfactory than this explanation of the Fall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assuming that determinists are wrong, and that the Creator is not
responsible for the shortcomings of His creatures, the only fault for
which primeval man could possibly be held to be answerable is that of
not controlling his animal instincts so soon as he commenced to be
conscious and could no longer claim the excuse of innocence. Probably
he did his best, and began to improve himself ever so little. In that
case, as the <i>Church Times</i> sapiently remarks, there was no Fall,
but an advance. Or, adopting a compromise suggested by an American
divine, he fell <i>upward</i>! If he did not strive as much as he might
have done, there was, at all events, no sudden leap over a precipice;
for the gift of increased consciousness, such as the human being now
possesses, must have evolved very gradually. However, the creation of
the world and all that therein is was also exceedingly gradual, and yet
the pious find themselves able to consider the Bible account to be an
accurate though allegorical representation of the process; so there is
really nothing to prevent them from considering the account of a
remarkable incident in a certain garden during a hot summer&rsquo;s
day, shortly after man put in his appearance on this globe, to be a
true representation of the perverse conduct of their ancestors through
countless ages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216"
name="pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>For this so-called &ldquo;Fall&rdquo; we are to be visited with a
death which will be the end of our hopes if we do not believe in
Christ. This, then, is the new threat held over the unbeliever: he will
forfeit his right to immortality. As it is in place of the
old-fashioned consignment to hell, we may hope, for the sake of the
human race as a whole, past and present, that the new Christian dogma
is nearer the truth than the old. Most of us, however, will, I think,
come to the conclusion that there has never been a &ldquo;Fall&rdquo;
at all in any sense. Dr. Gore in one breath asks us to think man so
much above the ape that his spiritual powers cannot have been evolved;
yet, when science points out that they were evolved&mdash;that man
<i>rose</i> so much above his relations&mdash;he still speaks of a
<i>fall</i>! It is an outrage to our common sense. And, if there were a
Fall, may we not say with the Persian poet?&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="main">THE ARCHDEACON OF MANCHESTER&rsquo;S THEORY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Archdeacon J. M. Wilson tells us<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4877src" href="#xd21e4877" name="xd21e4877src">55</a> that
&ldquo;We are taking our part in the long struggle of good against
evil. This has been often pictured to us as the struggle of God against
some Personal Power of Evil which we call Satan, the fact of struggle
suggesting two rival powers. But the evolutionary way of regarding it
presents the struggle as one of the divine element in man struggling to
overcome the purely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"
name="pb217">217</a>]</span>animal inheritance of lust and passion
inherited from a far by-gone stage.&rdquo; Dr. Wilson, therefore,
believes, as every thorough evolutionist must believe, that we have to
look to an animal and not a human ancestor for the ultimate origin of
what we call sin. But we want to know where the &ldquo;Fall&rdquo;
comes in, and this he has explained elsewhere,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4882src" href="#xd21e4882" name="xd21e4882src">56</a> in what
seems to me to be the only possible way open to an evolutionist. He
says: &ldquo;Man fell, according to science, when he first became
conscious of the conflict of freedom and conscience; and each
individual man falls as his ancestor fell.&rdquo; Dr. Wilson does not
attempt to make out that there was any particular &ldquo;fall&rdquo; at
any particular period in man&rsquo;s history, such as Dr. Gore
apparently still clings to; but he plainly tells us: &ldquo;I do not
mean to say that there is a particular moment at which men fell: <i>it
is not so</i>. It is a continuous struggle of good and evil.&rdquo; He
continues: &ldquo;I see in this nothing to conflict with a legitimate
interpretation of the story of the Fall in the third chapter of
Genesis. Such a narrative is not an illusion, still less a mere
fiction; it is, as all teaching of spiritual truth must be, a temporary
and figurative mode of expression.&rdquo; In other words, Dr. Wilson
considers these early chapters of Genesis, and probably a great deal
more of the Old Testament and some of the New, to be only an allegory.
With regard to the Atonement difficulty, Dr. Wilson&rsquo;s argument is
simply that &ldquo;We need only to look at the world as it is to see
the struggle of the two-fold nature in man; to see that it has need of
a Redemption, of a Saviour.&rdquo; Few, I fear, will accept this latest
explanation by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>a learned and earnest believer. Theologians, in
Dr. Wilson&rsquo;s opinion, have made a grievous mistake when they say:
&ldquo;If the story of the Fall is not literally true, then it is
literally false, and with it goes the need of a Redemption, of a
Saviour.&rdquo; Yet most people&mdash;and these will include the whole
body both of the old-fashioned orthodox and of the
unbelievers&mdash;will certainly side with those &ldquo;grievously
mistaken&rdquo; theologians.</p>

<p class="first">To many of us there seems no need whatever to have
recourse to the supernatural in order to account for the origin of sin.
It is not one of the mysteries of life. When we know who our ancestors
were, and hence why we possess certain instincts, it is quite
unnecessary to predicate a &ldquo;Fall.&rdquo; Details of the
Rationalist&rsquo;s view of sin (and of the reasons for morality) will

<p class="first">These, then, are the difficulties created by the
doctrine of Evolution. They are difficulties which appear completely to
impugn the very nature of God, the veracity of the Bible, and the
dogmas of sin and its atonement. We have already seen, by our study of
Bible criticism and comparative mythology, how grave are the grounds
for distrusting the Faith, and Evolution seems to be just the finishing
stroke that was required for confirming our suspicions. We must now see
whether there are any other arguments for belief of sufficient weight
to warrant us in over-stepping the boundaries of reason by an act of
faith. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=

<h4 class="main">THEISM, AND WHO ARE THEISTS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">First a word about theism. Theism is belief in the
existence of a God as the creator and ruler of the universe. It assumes
a living relation of God to his creatures, but does not define it.
Although <span class="trans" title="Theos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Theta;&epsilon;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span></span> and Deus are
equivalent, theism has come to be distinguished from deism. The latter,
according to some theologians, while equally opposed to atheism, denies
or ignores the personality of God, and therefore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>denies<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4938src" href=
"#xd21e4938" name="xd21e4938src">2</a> Christianity. Theism, on the
contrary, underlies Christianity. Accordingly, in considering the truth
or untruth of Christianity, we are concerned only with theism. However,
it should be borne in mind that, although a man cannot be a Christian
without being a Theist, he may be, and very often is in these days, a
Theist without being a Christian. Of the cultured men who think they
can still lay claim to the name of Christian, the bulk are, in point of
fact, non-Christian Theists. Some of these quiet their conscience by
the thought that they are still preserving a &ldquo;reverent
agnosticism&rdquo; with regard to Christian dogmas; while certain
anti-Haeckelites of the type of Professor E. Armitage (who urges
scientific men to &ldquo;remember that we only know appearances, and
that whenever we affirm anything about what lies behind appearances we
are making hazardous inferences&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4941src" href="#xd21e4941" name="xd21e4941src">3</a>) do not seem
to be aware that they are adherents of one of the fundamental
principles of agnosticism.</p>
<p>Theism in its modern Unitarian form is the creed of many of the most
cultured and most religious minds of our time, alike in Europe and
America; and it has also signally shown its power in contemporary
India. Before I left the latter country a few years ago, I had an
interesting discussion with one of the leading spirits of the Brahmo
Samaj movement, and, in answer to my queries, he replied that it was
with the Unitarians that he and his fellow thinkers were most in
sympathy, and that they were never likely to turn Christians. This
Unitarian theism, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span>may be remarked, is often seen to
approximate to, or become absorbed into, pantheism or agnosticism. But
it is not of Unitarians that I would speak so much as of the man who
calls and often thinks himself a Christian proper, notwithstanding the
admission that the Christian dogmas may be partially or wholly false.
This misconception of &ldquo;What it is to be a
Christian&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4950src" href="#xd21e4950"
name="xd21e4950src">4</a> is one of the many that tend to confuse and
delay a straight reply to the question, &ldquo;Is Christianity
true?&rdquo; Having digested these prefatory remarks, let us now
proceed to consider the Theistic arguments.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The hypothesis of modern science is that everything as
it now exists in the universe is the result of an infinite series of
causes and effects; everything that happens is the result of something
else that happened previously, and so on backwards to all eternity. The
agnostic scientist says that we know nothing about this Infinite Cause,
and that the idea of a First Cause is absurd. The Theist affirms that
there is an Eternal Infinite Being who is the First Cause. He says that
it is absurd not to believe in a First Cause, that materialistic
theories are so absurd compared with his that for this reason alone he
would remain a Theist. He appears entirely to lose sight of the fact
that by predicating a First Cause he only <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>removes the mystery a
stage further back. He tells us nothing about the origin of the First
Cause or the state of things that preceded it. The appearance of a
First Cause upon the scene only increases the great mystery. Certainly
it does not solve it. We are no forwarder. The creation of a mystery to
explain a mystery is a very ancient custom, but it is a custom that has
not met with the approbation of science.</p>
<p>The Theist apparently thinks, however, that he has science on his
side. Thus, in the Baird Lectures of 1876, Dr. Flint stated that
&ldquo;the progress of science has not more convincingly and completely
dispersed the once prevalent notion that the universe was created about
6,000 years ago than it has convincingly and completely established
that everything of which our senses inform us has had a commencement in
time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4972src" href="#xd21e4972"
name="xd21e4972src">6</a> This opinion is still proclaimed by the
Church to be the opinion of science. But modern science does not point
to a beginning of the scheme of things. The consensus of opinion is
entirely the other way. So far as we know, the ultimate cause recedes
for ever and ever beyond the time when there was no distinction of
earth and sea and atmosphere, all being mingled together in nebulous
matter. Where would the Theist fix the &ldquo;commencement&rdquo;? The
gaps on which theology at one time relied are rapidly disappearing. The
apparent chasm between the organic and inorganic, between the lifeless
and that which lives, according to the latest conceptions of science,
no longer exists. Man may even succeed in manufacturing life, so that
yet another teleological argument may collapse. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">DESIGN AND DIRECTIVITY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The argument from design is one which appeals perhaps
more than any other to the average man. As he looks around and
reflects, he feels that there must be design, and, therefore, a
Designer. He feels also that God must be constantly present directing
the carrying out of His design. He is in accord with the Theist who
maintains that purpose and plan are manifest throughout the cosmos, and
that, although it might be conceded that every step of the process has
been achieved by the forces of Evolution, it is impossible to exclude
the <i>presiding activity</i> of a mind which has planned the whole and
predetermined the movements of every portion. We are to believe, then,
that the Designer Himself put the forces in motion for the first time,
that He knew exactly what would be the product of those forces down to
the minutest detail and for all time, and yet, in face of the
undeviating law-regulated cosmos which He has created, He in some way
continues to guide these forces. From the very first step, the making
of the electron and thence the atom, to the last, the making of
man&rsquo;s brain, the Theist sees the finger of God. The mystery of
life is thus taken to be explained or diminished by asserting that it
is produced and controlled by some other mystery. The only alternative
to this belief, so he maintains, is a universe of random chance and
capricious disorder. But &ldquo;Haeckel and his colleagues hold that
the direction which the evolutionary agencies take is not
&lsquo;fortuitous&rsquo;; that they never could take but the one
direction which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224"
name="pb224">224</a>]</span>they have actually taken.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4997src" href="#xd21e4997" name="xd21e4997src">7</a>
While &ldquo;the Theist says the ultimate object must have been
foreseen and the forces must have been guided, or they would never have
worked steadily in this definite direction, the Monist says that these
forces no more needed guiding than does a tramcar; there was only one
direction possible for them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5003src"
href="#xd21e5003" name="xd21e5003src">8</a> To refute this the
apologist gravely replies that, &ldquo;if you cast to the ground an
infinite (or a finite) number of letters, they might after infinite
gyrations make a word here and there; but we should think the man an
enthusiast who expected even a short sentence, and a fool if he ever
expected them to make a poem.&rdquo; We are expected, it seems, to
regard it as a miracle that natural forces should not lose their
uniform character, and act miraculously! Evidently, either the question
is begged or the analogy is absurd. An argument of this kind is worse
than useless, for it only serves to demonstrate the hopelessness of the
teleologist&rsquo;s position. Spinoza&rsquo;s position is more
reasonable; for he conceives that all is the outcome of inexorable
necessity&mdash;that neither chance nor purpose governs the eternal and
the infinite.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch6.3.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">DIRECTIVITY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Directivity has hitherto been insisted upon by
Theists. It would not conform with our ideas of God that He should
remain a passive observer so soon as He had invented a machine that
would never stop, and had started it going. Yet interference with the
machinery is inconceivable, the universe being ruled by eternal,
immutable, and irrefragable laws. &ldquo;The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>only
possible conception of telic [purposeful] action on a cosmic scale is
that, from the start, the matter-force reality was of such a nature
that it would infallibly evolve into the cosmos we form part of to-day.
Any other conception of &lsquo;guidance&rsquo; and
&lsquo;control&rsquo; is totally unthinkable. And, as a fact, Theists
are settling down to formulate their position in that way. The
interference, as Ward says, took place <i>before</i> the process
began.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5018src" href="#xd21e5018"
name="xd21e5018src">9</a> A Law Maker can be postulated, but there is
not a particle of evidence that He is also a Law Breaker.</p>
<p>Attempts are still made, however, by clerical scientists to prove
that there is directivity. The Rev. Professor George Henslow, in his
book, <i>Present-Day Rationalism Critically Examined</i>, argues that
the tendency which living organisms show to develop in one direction
rather than another, and their capacity to respond to environment,
betoken a directing Mind. Granting, for the moment, that the doctrine
of Natural Selection is false or inadequate, it seems to me that the
acknowledged facts of the &ldquo;struggle for existence&rdquo; and
&ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; sufficiently dispose of this new
apology. Organisms do <i>not</i> all adapt themselves to environment,
and their fate, in consequence, is first one of increasing misery, and
finally of extinction. Only those that do adapt themselves survive. It
appears that a scientist when he turns apologist is conveniently able
to forget all but the more fortunate organisms.</p>

<p class="first">If the evidence for a <i>directing</i> Mind has to be
given up, the difficulties of a Theist are certainly increased.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>There would be difficulties, for instance,
regarding the utility of prayer. Still, he could think with Father
Waggett that &ldquo;the interaction of forces <i>inherent</i> in the
whole produces the infinite variety of living beauty which we
see.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5044src" href="#xd21e5044" name=
"xd21e5044src">10</a> And he can still join with Dr. Flint in
exclaiming: &ldquo;Every atom, every molecule, must, even in what is
ultimate in it, bear the impress of a Supernatural Power and Wisdom;
must reflect the glory of God, and proclaim its dependence upon
Him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5049src" href="#xd21e5049" name=
"xd21e5049src">11</a> To remain a Theist, however, one must have not
only evidence of design, but of the benevolent intention of the
Designer. Before considering the latter question, I venture to offer a
few further remarks about the former. Is there consistent evidence of
design?</p>
<p><i>Beauty.</i>&mdash;As a proof of design we are asked by the Theist
to contemplate the beauty and sublimity which the universe exhibits.
Let us contemplate, then, the beauty of the Bay of Naples. Is it not
purely accidental, purely the outcome of natural agencies, of effects
produced by position, distance, etc.? Again, &ldquo;the beauty of the
diatoms that are brought from the lowest depths of the ocean, the
beauty of the radiolaria that swarm about the coast, and the beauty of
a thousand minute animal structures, are obviously not designed and
purposed beauties. They were unknown until the microscope was invented;
the polariscope reveals yet further beauties; the telescope yet more.
The idea of these being designed for our, or for God&rsquo;s,
entertainment belongs, as Mr. Mallock says, &lsquo;to a pre-scientific

"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>is
sometimes urged that the tendency of evolution is towards greater
beauty. Is it? That all depends upon what your idea of beauty may
be&mdash;whether you will consider the structure best suited to its
environment beautiful or otherwise. We are told that there are signs
that the human race will one day be toothless. At present we admire
pretty teeth; perhaps our descendants will go into raptures over a
toothless gum. That their sense of beauty may not be outraged, let us
hope it may be so. The hideous pigmies of Central Africa probably think
themselves beautiful, and in the distant future, when the conditions of
existence on this globe have radically changed, and when its
inhabitants have adapted themselves to those conditions, the new
&ldquo;beauties&rdquo; may possibly be quite as ugly as &ldquo;missing
links.&rdquo; After all, beauty is a matter of taste. The sufficient
objection to the &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; argument is, to my mind,
contained in a very few words: &ldquo;Look at the ugliness! Who
designed that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Harmony.</i>&mdash;But, it will be urged, if beauty is a poor
argument, at least you must grant that the general harmony in Nature
still remains to be accounted for. Beauty is only one of its countless
harmonies. The objection to this argument is a very simple one. Nature
is full of discords. Ugliness is by no means the only discord. It is
because this is so little realised that M. Elie Metchnikoff has devoted
nearly the whole of his book, <i>The Nature of Man</i>, to the
discussion of the disharmonies in man&rsquo;s nature alone. There are
disharmonies in the organisation of the digestive system, in the
organisation and activities of the reproductive apparatus, in the
family and social instincts, and in the instinct of self-preservation,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>etc. For instance, in the human body there are
disharmonies of the wisdom teeth, the <i lang="fr">b&ecirc;te-noire</i>
of dentistry; of the useless vermiform appendage, the seat of the
disease appendicitis; of the large intestine, which could very well be
dispensed with, and is the seat of many grave diseases, such as
dysentery, and so on. The perversions of instinct among human beings
(another disharmony) are likely to be attributed by the conservative
Theist to the Devil, and by the liberal to Dr. Gore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fall
from Without,&rdquo; so it will be better to take an example from the
animal world. Darwin informs us that the &ldquo;female of one of the
emus (<i>Drom&oelig;us irroratus</i>), as soon as she catches sight of
her progeny, becomes violently agitated, and, notwithstanding the
resistance of the father, appears to use her utmost endeavours to
destroy them&rdquo; (<i>Descent of Man</i>, vol. ii., chap, xvi., pp.
204&ndash;205). To those who still hold by this argument I can only
recommend a perusal of Professor Metchnikoff&rsquo;s book of
disharmonies, and would beg them to remember that it has been written
by a man whose profession and attainments entitle his opinions on such
a subject to the highest consideration. The cruelty attending the
process by which harmony is attained has already been commented upon by
me in &sect; 2 of the previous chapter.</p>

<h4 class="main">DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AMONG THEISTIC APOLOGISTS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have finally to call attention to the fact that even
among the apologists themselves there is considerable difference of
opinion as to the value of these arguments for Theism. Dr. Flint
exclaims: &ldquo;Strange as it may seem, there are many <i>Theists</i>
at the present day who represent it [revelation of God <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>in
the whole of nature external to us] as insufficient, or even worthless,
and who join the Atheists in denying that God&rsquo;s existence can be
proved, and in affirming that all the arguments for His existence are
inconclusive and sophistical. Such Theists seem to me not only the best
allies of Atheists, but even more effective labourers in the cause of
unbelief than Atheists themselves.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5094src" href="#xd21e5094" name="xd21e5094src">13</a> Since Dr.
Flint wrote these words the number of &ldquo;such Theists&rdquo; has
vastly increased. It is owned on all sides by the advanced school of
apologists that God&rsquo;s existence cannot be proved by an appeal to
the reasoning faculties; and, among other arguments, that from design
is gradually being discarded.</p>
<p>Father Waggett offers us interesting information regarding this
argument in his little book, <i>Religion and Science</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5104src" href="#xd21e5104" name=
"xd21e5104src">14</a> He considers that Paley and others of the old
teleologists were wrong in leaning upon a narrow argument from design.
&ldquo;It need not here be repeated,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that the
evidence of such workmanship cannot prove God in the true sense of an
<i>infinite</i> and <i>all</i>-wise Cause; but only a cause possessed
of immense wisdom and immense though limited power, a Demiurgus of the
greatest force and the most minute care, but not a Creator in the sense
of theology.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5113src" href=
"#xd21e5113" name="xd21e5113src">15</a> Father Waggett, who is a
biologist, and, therefore, necessarily an Evolutionist, would not be
disconcerted if living things were manufactured in the laboratory
to-morrow. In his opinion, &ldquo;If anywhere we catch nature in the
making, if we surprise the sequence by which even man himself gained
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>difference from other things, we shall not by
this find reverence lowered.... It is a <i>theological</i> readjustment
which is required, and not one in &lsquo;natural
science.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5124src" href=
"#xd21e5124" name="xd21e5124src">16</a> The position here taken up is
wise, and one that all who remain Theists will eventually have to
adopt. But for most of us these theological readjustments are no easy
matter. We reason that Paley&rsquo;s <i>Evidences</i> have in their
time assisted men to be Theists, and now his arguments are condemned by
the better informed. How do we know that the same fate may not await
the new arguments of the Christian evolutionist? How is it that God
allowed earnest and learned divines to commit themselves to arguments
in proof of His existence, the subsequent overthrow of which has been a
potent cause for unbelief?</p>

<h4 class="main">A PERSONAL GOD.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As ages roll on, God&rsquo;s attributes&mdash;or
rather, we should say, the attributes given Him by man&mdash;are
continually altering. All that the early gods demanded was fear and
worship. Even the Jehovah of the Jews asked at first little else than
this. Anthropomorphic conceptions of God are now admitted by the
cultured to be a thing of the past. Do they not, however, still survive
when human emotions, such as love and anger, happiness and sorrow, are
attributed to the Deity? We acknowledge God to be infinite, and,
consequently, incomprehensible by finite minds; yet we imagine and
attempt to argue that He possesses the same qualities&mdash;those we
most admire&mdash;as ourselves! &ldquo;How can we believe in a
<i>personal</i> God?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>asks the Rationalist. &ldquo;A
person must have limitations, or he ceases to be a person.&rdquo;
However, we must not forget that in philosophy and theology the word
&ldquo;person&rdquo; simply implies &ldquo;a nature endowed with
consciousness,&rdquo; and does not involve limits. Demurring to this
definition, there still remains another difficulty. In all our
experience and knowledge, emotions and intelligence are connected with
nerve structures; how, then, can we attribute these qualities to a
Being who is described to us as devoid of any nerve structure? I know
of no answer that could be called satisfactory from a Theistic
standpoint.</p>
<p>In the previous section we considered the doctrine of final causes.
This doctrine, as Spinoza points out,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5149src" href="#xd21e5149" name="xd21e5149src">17</a> &ldquo;does
away with the perfection of God; for, if God acts for an object, He
necessarily desires something which He lacks.&rdquo; The Theist goes a
step further than the mere teleologist, and insists on a
<i>benevolent</i> purpose throughout nature. Is he, then, oblivious to
Spinoza&rsquo;s objection? No, he is not; and therefore it is that he
struggles to save his personal God by an infinite extension of the
limits of His personality. In fine, Theism, in the hands of its modern
advocates, and in spite of the seeming orthodoxy of the phrase,
&ldquo;Divine Immanence,&rdquo; is often nothing less than another form
of Pantheism.</p>

well as Deism and Monism, while it harmonises with Trinitarianism. We
are to &ldquo;conceive of God as at once transcending <i>and</i>
immanent in nature.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5177src" href=

<p class="first">In another place,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5208src"
href="#xd21e5208" name="xd21e5208src">24</a> when speaking again of the
doctrine of the Trinity, he says: &ldquo;Men forget that it supports
and is supported by the whole weight of a fact in history, with which
nothing else in the wide world can even for a moment be compared. That
fact is the age-long empire of Jesus Christ over the hearts of
men.&rdquo; This, then, is the final argument in support of the
Christian dogmas, including this the most incomprehensible of them all.
Why should not the Buddhist claim the same authority for the dogmas of
his faith? The evidential value is precisely the same. Turn to any
well-known work bearing on this phase of the question. Read, we will
say, Edwin Arnold&rsquo;s poem, <i>The Light of Asia</i>; or, better
still, read Mr. Fielding&rsquo;s books, <i>The Soul of a People</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>and <i>The Hearts of Men</i>, and hear the words
of one who has lived for years among Buddhists and studied their
hearts.</p>
<p>That an ideal should reign over the hearts of men is no new thing;
much less is this a cause for marvel when &ldquo;One has come, claiming
to be God made manifest&mdash;manifest in order to attract our
love.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5226src" href="#xd21e5226"
name="xd21e5226src">25</a> Christian apologists urge that He has not
only attracted the hearts of men in the past, but still retains His
hold upon their affections, and that therein lies an essential
difference between Christianity and all other religions. Christianity,
say they, in this respect at least, stands pre-eminently alone. Is not
Buddhism, then, one of the great living religions of the present day?
Has it not existed during twenty-four centuries? Does it not at the
present time surpass, in the number of its followers and the area of
its prevalence, any other form of creed? Is not Gautama Buddha worthy
of men&rsquo;s love, if we are to credit the best authenticated records
of his life? &ldquo;Discordant in frequent particulars,&rdquo;
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5231src" href="#xd21e5231" name=
"xd21e5231src">26</a> Sir Edwin Arnold, &ldquo;and sorely overlaid by
corruptions, inventions, and misconceptions, the Buddhistical books yet
agree in the one point of recording nothing&mdash;no single act or
word&mdash;which mars the perfect purity and tenderness of this Indian
teacher, who united the truest princely qualities with the intellect of
a sage and the passionate devotion of a martyr.&rdquo; Loving
disciples, living in an age of ignorance and superstition, piously
ascribed to him divine powers, and, disobeying his mandate, gave him
fervent worship. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234"

<h4 class="main">THE PAST AND PRESENT POSITION OF THE ETHICAL
ARGUMENT.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In my comments upon Dr. Illingworth&rsquo;s views
regarding &ldquo;Divine Immanence&rdquo; I fear I have digressed
somewhat from the subject at present under consideration&mdash;the
Theistic argument from a Beneficent Intelligence. &ldquo;The ethical
argument held a very subordinate place in the estimation of writers on
natural theology until Kant rested on it almost the whole weight of
Theism. It has ever since been prominent, and has been the argument
most relied upon to produce practical conviction.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5241src" href="#xd21e5241" name=
"xd21e5241src">27</a> What was once the weakest argument has now become
the strongest. Why? Not, I take it, because anything has occurred to
make the weaker any stronger, but because what was thought to be the
strongest is now found to be weaker than the weakest! How can the
ethical argument be maintained in face of objections which continue to
become ever graver as our knowledge increases? Theists contend<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5247src" href="#xd21e5247" name=
"xd21e5247src">28</a> that there must be a future life if only because
the glaring wrongs of this world have to be righted. What is this but a
na&iuml;ve admission that the proofs of the Deity&rsquo;s benevolence
are sadly wanting? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235"

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">EVIL FOR WHICH MAN IS <i>NOT</i> HELD
RESPONSIBLE.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The problem of pain, and of evil generally, has been
partially discussed in the chapter on &ldquo;Evolution.&rdquo; The
importance of this problem is very great, for, by the universal consent
of Christendom (<i>not</i> of mankind, as we shall see later on), the
very name of God carries with it the sense of goodness, the highest and
best that we know of or can imagine. For this reason it is customary
for the pious to regard every calamity reverently as a punishment from
God, or as serving some good purpose. Thus the German Emperor, imbued
from childhood with this pious theory, warned his people that the
Japanese had been sent as a scourge from God, and Father Bernard
Vaughan (preaching at Lancaster on August 26th, 1906) declared that God
had uttered warnings to <i>England</i> by the eruption of Vesuvius and
the San Franciscan and Chilian earthquakes. Can this supposition be
maintained when the catastrophe occurs in the wrong place, when
tornadoes and earthquakes destroy God&rsquo;s own temples, and when the
innocent suffer for the guilty? With the opinion of the scientist we
are, or ought to be by now, familiar. &ldquo;The fundamental axiom of
scientific thought is that there is not, never has been, and never will
be, any disorder in Nature. The admission of the occurrence of any
event which was not the logical consequence of the immediately
antecedent events, according to those definite, ascertained, or
unascertained rules which we call the &lsquo;laws of Nature,&rsquo;
would be an act of self-destruction on the part of science&rdquo;
(Huxley on Catastrophes, p. 247 of his <i>Essays on Controverted
Questions</i>).</p>
<p>I remember, at the time of the terrible catastrophe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>in
Martinique, due to the eruption of Mont Pel&eacute;e, asking a lady:
&ldquo;Do you think this wholesale slaughter and awful suffering has
any connection with the wickedness of the afflicted people?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;they must have been very
wicked people.&rdquo; It just so happened that the only man who escaped
scatheless was a murderer who had been imprisoned in a cell below
ground. So the theory she and I had been brought up to believe in would
not work, whichever way you looked at it. The apologist has usually a
number of strings to his bow; and, as the Old Testament teaching
concerning bad men descending &ldquo;quick into the pit&rdquo; would
not suit, he might argue that the criminal was given an opportunity for
repentance. In that case, we must suppose that all the others who
perished had no need of repentance. Again, with regard to the terrible
tortures that many endured, it could be argued that those &ldquo;whom
the Lord loveth He chasteneth&rdquo;; but what possible object could
there be in this chastening during the last moments of their life upon
earth? The agony of the death-struggle, suffered by the good and the
bad alike, has yet to be shown to be in accord with the theory of a
benevolent Deity.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned idea that catastrophes, plagues, famines, etc.,
were sent as punishments for our misdoings is gradually being modified.
Dr. Flint says distinctly: &ldquo;I cannot agree with those who think
there is no mystery in mere pain&mdash;that it is sufficiently
accounted for by moral evil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5280src"
href="#xd21e5280" name="xd21e5280src">29</a> It seems a pity that his
advocacy for benevolence in the Deity should lead him afterwards to
qualify this sensible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>statement by an amazing assertion
which begs the whole question. &ldquo;The character of pain
itself,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is such as to indicate that its author
must be a benevolent being&mdash;one who does not afflict for his own
pleasure, but for his creatures&rsquo; profit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5287src" href="#xd21e5287" name="xd21e5287src">30</a> The
profit consists, we are told, in the fact that we are prevented through
fear of pain from running into danger. How peculiarly appropriate and
consolatory such a view of pain must be to, let us say, a person
crippled with rheumatoid arthritis! Man&rsquo;s highly sensitive and
delicate organisation inevitably entails pain when no useful purpose of
this kind can possibly be served; yet we are to suppose that an
Omnipotent Being devised this crude and cruel method for teaching us to
avoid the perils with which He Himself has surrounded us! One of our
greatest living surgeons, Sir Frederick Treves, assures us<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5292src" href="#xd21e5292" name=
"xd21e5292src">31</a> that &ldquo;the symptoms of disease are marked by
purpose, and the purpose is beneficent.&rdquo; &ldquo;The processes of
disease,&rdquo; he goes on to explain, &ldquo;aim not at the
destruction of life, but at the saving of it.&rdquo; Here, indeed, is
more grist for the mill of the apologist. But what does this special
pleading amount to? To this: Because through suffering we <i>may</i>
survive a dangerous disease, we should be grateful to the Supreme
Intelligence who created the preservative as well as the destructive
microbes; we should be grateful to the Almighty who has fashioned
friend and foe, and who, much to our discomfort, has selected our
interior economy for the battlefield! Surely, if the surmise of
benevolence is to be entertained at all, it must be at the sacrifice of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>the surmise of omnipotence. The Supreme
Intelligence cannot be an &ldquo;Almighty God&rdquo; if He be the
&ldquo;Father of all mercies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are Theists who candidly admit the perplexities of the
situation. On the horns of a dilemma they have no option but to fall
back upon the primitive theory: All unaccountable evil is the work of a
hostile and evil power which seeks continually to frustrate the
benevolent intentions of the Creator. &ldquo;Speaking for
myself,&rdquo; says the author of <i>Pro Fide</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5306src" href="#xd21e5306" name="xd21e5306src">32</a> &ldquo;I
am unable to believe that hideous and excruciating diseases, such as
cancer, which affect both men and animals, and which cannot, in the
case of <i>animals</i> at least, be explained as a moral discipline,
are the work of a good and benevolent God. I endorse absolutely the
words of Dr. E. A. Abbott. &lsquo;I cannot think,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;of diseases and pain, and the conflict in the animal world for
life and death, as being, so to speak, part of God&rsquo;s <i>first
intention</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; Disease, suffering, the struggle for
existence, and the law of prey are then, after all, the Devil&rsquo;s
handiwork, and so is also, presumably, the law of the survival of the
fittest. (Christian evolutionists, take note! In exonerating and
extolling the evolutionary processes, you are exonerating and extolling
the works of the Devil!) &ldquo;The Zoroastrian view,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;must be rejected because it postulates two first
principles, which is a plain metaphysical impossibility.&rdquo; The
view which is not open <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>to this or any other objection,
and which he calls the Theistic view, &ldquo;supposes that a large
share of the government of the material universe was committed, at the
creation, to a <i>personal spirit</i>, of great, but not unlimited,
power and intelligence, who, having been originally created good,
subsequently fell, and introduced evil and disorder into the world....
This hypothesis of a personal devil has many advantages. It explains
the whole of the facts; it avoids the postulation of two first causes;
it vindicates the moral perfection of the Deity; and it allows the
optimistic hope to be entertained that in the end good will triumph
over evil.&rdquo; All this is highly instructive. For it means that, in
the opinion of an erudite apologist of the Church of England,
flourishing a.d. 1906, the moral perfection of the Deity can only be
vindicated on the hypothesis of a personal devil! Doubtless this
hypothesis&mdash;and, remember, it is nothing more than a hypothesis,
and one that is now generally discredited&mdash;fits in admirably; but
the question is, Are we to accept it, however imaginary and opposed to
the facts of science, just because it is so suitable?</p>
<p>There remains the usual retort of the religionist when closely
cornered: &ldquo;The finite mind cannot expect to understand the
Infinite.&rdquo; He appears to forget entirely that when he advances
proofs of the God of his heart he himself is using his finite mind, and
that his opponents therefore have an equal right to use theirs when
criticising his &ldquo;proofs.&rdquo; This by the way. The particular
point we have to notice is that the appeal to this negative argument
amounts to an admission that the proofs do indeed appear all the other
way. Thus in the question now before us, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>&ldquo;Is the First
Cause a beneficent intelligence?&rdquo; we find that a statement
confidently proclaimed by the pious is not only unsupported by
evidence, but in spite of it&mdash;a mere assertion suggested by the
emotions. With more modesty and (may I add?) with more common sense,
the agnostic disclaims any knowledge of God, holding that human
knowledge is limited to experience, and that, since the absolute and
unconditioned, if it exists at all, cannot fall within experience, we
have no right to assert anything whatever with regard to it.</p>

upon the proof of His morality. <i>The argument from moral order</i>
seems at first sight a strong one. Morality, even adopting the

self-punishing.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5341src" href=
"#xd21e5341" name="xd21e5341src">33</a> But the Rationalist asks:
&ldquo;Why design man&rsquo;s nature so that he is more likely to go
wrong, when he gets the chance, than to go right; and this in despite
of the moral or social instinct?&rdquo; The usual answer of the
religionist is that, if we could not do wrong, we should be mere
machines. &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; says the author of <i>Pro Fide</i>,
&ldquo;if God had made us what Mr. Huxley says we are, <i>conscious
automata</i>, we should have been incapable of sin; but it is better to
be men, with all the glorious possibilities of freedom and virtue, than
to be machines, however <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>excellent.&rdquo; Now, do we allow
our children to choose for themselves when we know they will choose
wrongly? Do we not guard them against the inglorious
possibilities&mdash;the slavery of vice? If we fail in our duty to them
and they fall, should we add to our guilt by perpetrating on them
unimaginable cruelties? Again, do we not prefer the fellowship of the
good-<i>natured</i>? Yet these, according to the religionist, are the
veriest automata compared with those who have inherited vicious or
disagreeable characteristics, and do their best to fight against them.
Be this as it may, the fact remains that the less fortunately endowed
are seldom able to raise themselves up to the level of the more
fortunately endowed&mdash;environment may, of course, elevate the one,
as it may also degrade the other&mdash;and there is no doubt whose
society we prefer. Why should it be better for men to be capable
of&mdash;or, rather, may we not say prone to&mdash;sin? Why should
their Maker grant them &ldquo;glorious possibilities&rdquo; which He
has denied to Himself? Why should He alone be a machine that cannot go
wrong? Surely there is something amiss in an argument that furnishes
such inadequate excuses in order to explain why the Designer gave us
natures infinitely inferior to His own.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Some of Nature&rsquo;s plans would appear to be
specially designed to bring out the worst side of the diverse nature
implanted in man. The plan of the struggle for existence is a palpable
instance. Take another&mdash;take the plan for the reproduction of
life. Could any <i>Omnipotent</i> Being be proud of it? Let alone the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>unfair division of pain, which the discredited
Eden story can now no longer account for, is it helpful to man in his
struggle to improve his nature? The plan being God&rsquo;s plan, it is
enjoined upon us that the procreation of children is a sacred duty; but
it is also plainly intimated that to abstain from marriage altogether
is yet more meritorious. Similarly in Mithraism, Buddhism, the
religions of ancient America and other pre-Christian cults, the
sanctity of the celibate life is upheld. If man is not doing his best
in obeying the behests of his Maker, how can he do right? Has he been
given a fair chance when an instinct so hurtful is implanted in him
that even its natural gratification in the divinely appointed manner is
likely to hinder him in the cultivation of his spiritual nature; this
although matrimony was ordained&mdash;so our prayer-book tells
us&mdash;for a remedy against sin? The truth is that this
<i>necessary</i> instinct, quite apart from its responsibility for much
sorrow and strife and quite apart from its terrible tendency to
perversion, is innately prejudicial to our moral elevation, and, in
order to preserve a healthy, happy mind, the less we allow our thoughts
to dwell upon its fulfilment the better.</p>
<p>Again, &ldquo;a very little disorder in the organisation of the
brain suffices to cause hallucinations of the senses, to shake the
intellect from its throne, to paralyse the will, and to <i>corrupt the

<h4 class="main">CONSCIENCE.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Regarding theories of the origin of conscience such as
those of J. S. Mill, Bain, Darwin, and Spencer, Dr. Flint remarks:
&ldquo;It does not matter whether conscience be primary or derivative;
it exists.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5397src" href="#xd21e5397"
name="xd21e5397src">35</a> That it does matter is shown by the fact
that the bulk of the apologists still stoutly maintain that conscience
is a special attribute of man&mdash;a divine instinct&mdash;and is not
derived from the lower animals. We have, I think, gone into this
sufficiently in the previous chapter, and I shall confine my remarks to
another aspect of the question&mdash;the fallibility of the moral
consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The existence,&rdquo; it is urged, &ldquo;of a moral
principle within us, of a conscience which witnesses against sin and on
behalf of holiness, is of itself evidence that God must be a moral
being, one who hates sin and loves holiness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5404src" href="#xd21e5404" name="xd21e5404src">36</a> Given
the existence of a personal God, this argument is plausible enough till
we examine it more closely. The liability of conscience to err is, or
should be, a platitude. Its two components&mdash;the reason and the
emotions&mdash;both being fallible, it necessarily follows that
conscience must have the same quality. We have only to think for a
moment to discover innumerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>examples in proof of this. An
illustration which occurs to me, and which will hurt no one&rsquo;s
susceptibilities, is that of the Wa Daruma. This is an East African
tribe practising a strict morality which is all the more remarkable on
account of the gross immorality of the neighbouring tribes.
Nevertheless, the conscience of the Wa Daruma bids them kill their twin
offspring. If conscience, then, be fallible, how is it a Theistic
proof? Because, though it may make a mistake through an untutored
reason, or through a reason clouded by deceptive emotions, the
consciousness that there is a right or wrong at all is sufficient proof
of a moral intelligence? So be it; but it is passing strange that God
should allow conscience to deceive us. John Locke well said, many years
ago: &ldquo;Children are travellers newly arrived in a strange country:
we should therefore <i>make conscience not to deceive them</i>.&rdquo;
Are we not children of God in a strange country? <i>We</i> would not
deceive our children. The acquittal of conscience gives pleasure, as
the condemnation gives pain&mdash;remorse&mdash;and every man must obey
his conscience if he would be happy. What a thousand pities it seems
that it should ever lead him into error! Should it not be a divine
intuition of the right both in our religious beliefs and in our
conduct?</p>
<p>It <i>is</i> an intuition of the right, the believer will say, when
it tells you to believe in Christ and God. I would gladly think so; but
every believer of every creed on the face of the earth says the same
about his belief, and hence the amazing persistence of erroneous
beliefs. When the voice of conscience is composed of a blind reliance
on intuition (<i>i.e.</i>, on the emotions) and a distrust of reason,
how can the result be otherwise? The whole question of the truth of
beliefs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>hinges upon whether intuition can or cannot be
relied upon. We know that mistakes do occur through trusting to
intuition, especially in the matter of beliefs; how, then, can we
assume that it is infallible? Strange as the freaks of faith among
cultured persons may appear, they are perfectly intelligible. They are
the result of reliance on intuition rather than on reason. I will give
an example. Who more logical, apparently, than John Henry Newman, the
coadjutor of Whately in his popular work on logic? His illogical
conduct is, therefore, particularly instructive. In 1832, after a visit
to Rome, he wrote describing the Roman Catholic religion as
polytheistic, degrading, and idolatrous,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5429src" href="#xd21e5429" name="xd21e5429src">37</a> and then,
after all, entered the Roman Catholic Church in 1845. He did so because
he found that the difficulties of the creed and of the canon of
Scripture were insurmountable unless over-ridden by the authority of
the Church. To escape becoming an agnostic he elected to join a Church
calling herself infallible. He was able to come to this decision
although, to his own knowledge, her infallibility was belied by her
conduct! Further, so eloquent was his reasoning on the subject, so
apparently logical, that some hundreds of clergymen joined him in
making their submission to the Church of Rome. Underlying all this
apparent inconsistency is the assertion, so eloquently pleaded by
Cardinal Newman, of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href=
"#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>supremacy of conscience and the
correctness of intuition. So also have asserted the followers of every
religion from all time, and to what have their consciences and
intuitions led them&mdash;to truth, or to a pot-pourri of absurd and
conflicting beliefs? We have the testimony of all history to prove the
extreme fallibility of conscience. Conscience possesses no divine spark
to keep a man from acting wrongly through ignorance. Even when
knowledge is present we see, as in Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s case, that
the voice of conscience may still speak incorrectly; for reason is
swamped when emotion&rsquo;s flood-gate is left ajar.</p>
<p>Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s opinions have a special interest for us at
the present time. He held that, &ldquo;<i>apart from an interior and
unreasoned conviction, there is no cogent proof of the existence of
God</i>&rdquo;; that &ldquo;the man who has not this interior
conviction <i>has no choice but to remain an agnostic</i>, while the
man who has it <i>is bound sooner or later to become a Roman
Catholic</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5448src" href=
"#xd21e5448" name="xd21e5448src">38</a></p>
<p>So inexplicable did his motives appear that Charles Kingsley accused
him of saying that &ldquo;truth for its own sake need not be, and, on
the whole, ought not to be, a virtue of the Roman clergy.&rdquo;
Newman&rsquo;s <i>Apologia pro Vita Sua</i>, however, leaves no doubt
of the author&rsquo;s own personal rectitude. His premises&mdash;the
infallibility of conscience and intuition&mdash;were false. But that is
not an unusual feature of Christian apologetics. The keen intellects of
the two pious brothers, John Henry and Francis William, were really
buried beneath a mass of preconceptions. That of the latter, however,
being less submissive, proceeded to a slow and sure upheaval, and
finally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>Francis Newman rejected Christianity
altogether.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5460src" href="#xd21e5460" name=
"xd21e5460src">39</a> In the <i>Apologia pro Vita Sua</i> we find, I
think, the key to Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s convictions. <i>He was
intensely superstitious</i>, and inclined also to be timid. On the
opening page, where he gives the recollections of his boyhood, we read:
&ldquo;I used to wish the Arabian tales were true.&rdquo; And again:
&ldquo;I was very superstitious, and for some time previous to my
conversion (when I was fifteen) used constantly to cross myself on
going into the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">FREEWILL.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In my remarks on the &ldquo;evil for which man is held
responsible,&rdquo; I have alluded to the Rationalist&rsquo;s
contention that man cannot be justly blamed for his actions, and that,
if there be a God, He alone is to blame. This opens up the question of
Freewill <i>v.</i> Determinism&mdash;a thorny question, which I should
prefer, if only for considerations of space and my readers&rsquo;
patience, to leave severely alone. A whole volume would be necessary to
present the case for Determinism adequately, and I am fully aware that
a few brief words will fail to convince; but, if I can remove a single
iota of the misconceptions on this subject, I shall feel rewarded.</p>
<p>Kant defines an act of volition as an act which is determined by the
anticipatory idea of the result of the act. Although he maintains that
there must be a moral God, he fully admits that the forecast or
anticipatory idea is the inevitable effect of precedent conditions,
such as temperament (heredity), education (environment), and the like;
and in a well-known <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248"
name="pb248">248</a>]</span>passage he says that, if the whole history
of the subject could be known, the voluntary acts of a man might be
predicted with the same certainty as an eclipse. The tendency of modern
psychology is in the same direction. All voluntary acts, we are told,
depend on the memory of involuntary acts of the same sort previously
performed. It is true that a few Christian psychologists leave room for
a &ldquo;sheer heave&rdquo; of the will by means of which an idea
naturally feeble is fortified and held in place; but when they speak in
this wise they speak as metaphysicians. No metaphysical argument, it
seems to me, can reconcile this inflexible causality with <i>true</i>
freedom of will. How can the will be at one and the same time fettered
and free? There is, I grant, every appearance of freewill; but it
belongs to the category of appearances which deceive.</p>
<p>If we accept the Christian contention, we have to believe that a
benevolent God gives us a free will, the power to choose between Him
and the Devil, knowing, as in His omniscience He must, that the vast
majority will make a sad use of their gift! The modern Christian admits
that heredity and environment have their say also. Thus there are, in
all, four forces struggling for the mastery&mdash;God, the Devil,
heredity and environment; and it is the duty of the divinely-implanted
free will to choose between them. Rather, is it not that there are two
forces, and two forces only&mdash;heredity and environment&mdash;acting
upon our brain, and our choice is the resultant of them? Undoubtedly
man, as a self-conscious and reflecting animal, has what may be called
the power of choice; but the way this power will be used would be a
foregone conclusion did we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>know the sum-total of the effect
of heredity and environment up to the moment of its use.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; it may be objected, &ldquo;surely there is such a
thing as will-power. We can overcome our heredity and environment by
the exercise of our will. Temptations to which the weak-willed succumb
do not affect the strong-willed. Here, at least, we have a distinct
instance in which heredity and environment are overcome.&rdquo; Yes, it
is true, of course, that heredity and environment are continually being
overcome by the happy possessor of sufficient will-power; but what we
have to bear in mind is that it is not a portion, but the whole, of a
man&rsquo;s heredity and environment which must be taken into
consideration. In the case of the man with the strong will, it is still
his heredity and environment which have in the first instance settled
the line of conduct to which, once resolved upon, he adheres so
tenaciously. And, again, this particular quality of the mind which
enables him to keep to his resolution is, like all other qualities of
the mind, itself the product of heredity and environment.</p>
<p>The Determinism of science and the Freewill of metaphysics are
essentially antagonistic. Determinism is completely subversive of
Christian teaching. It is directly opposed to the Thirty-nine Articles
of religion. Not only does it imply that man is not to blame for his
actions, but that, if there be a God, He, and He alone, is to blame.
Christian theologists are therefore its strenuous opponents. In their
apologetic efforts one finds the strangest misconceptions of what is
meant in a broad sense by heredity and environment. The best apology I
have seen so far is by the Rev. P. N. Waggett, in a tractate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>called <i>Science and Conduct</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5498src" href="#xd21e5498" name=
"xd21e5498src">40</a> Father Waggett seems to realise better than most
of his fellow-clerics the enormous influence of heredity and
environment. Still he comes to the conclusion that &ldquo;when, under
given circumstances,&rdquo; a man &ldquo;does what, <i>under those
circumstances</i>, and with his given constitution, he usually does not
do,&rdquo; he is exercising &ldquo;some inward spring.&rdquo; The
fallacy in this argument is the common one. The effect of environment
<i>up to</i> the moment of action has not been considered. The
obscurity of the expression &ldquo;given constitution&rdquo; is
doubtless unintentional, but it is none the less misleading. Father
Waggett would be the first to admit that something must have occurred
meanwhile to account for the new frame of mind. It is for him to show
that an alteration in environment is not all that has occurred, and
that there is room for this &ldquo;inward spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will not the acceptance of this doctrine have a paralysing effect
upon us? On the contrary. We shall be better able to discern where our
salvation lies. We shall pay far more attention to the real forces
which determine conduct. We shall devote our energies to combating bad
heredity with good environment; and we shall do this with the knowledge
that not only ourselves and our associates, but our descendants also,
will reap the benefit. We shall fly from unhealthy thoughts, and avoid
the surroundings likely to give rise to them. We shall welcome healthy
thoughts and seek helpful surroundings.</p>
<p>The doctrine of determinism is thought likely to corrupt our moral
character, but, in reality, it compares favourably with religious
doctrines. The belief in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>God&rsquo;s omniscience leads the
Mohammedan to fatalism, and the Christian to the doctrine of
predestination. If a Christian really believed as he professes, if he
could honestly subscribe to the seventeenth article of his
Creed&mdash;in which it is stated that &ldquo;before the foundations of
the world were laid God hath constantly decreed by His counsel secret
to us, to deliver from curse and damnation <i>those whom He hath
chosen</i> [the italics are mine, of course] in Christ out of
mankind&rdquo;&mdash;God&rsquo;s Predestination would indeed be
&ldquo;a dangerous downfall,&rdquo; &ldquo;thrusting men into
desperation.&rdquo; The doctrine of predestination, therefore, appears,
without doubt, to be ethically mischievous. The doctrine of
Determinism, on the other hand, teaches a man to fight pernicious
hereditary instincts with the weapon of environment, and to keep a
tender place in his heart for unfortunates who succumb.<a class=

<h4 class="main">MYSTICISM AND CONVERSION.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of late, the argument from &ldquo;Religious
Experience&rdquo; has been much to the front, and nothing written on
the subject has created a deeper impression, or been more cordially
welcomed by the supernaturalist, than Professor W. James&rsquo;s book,
<i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>. Professor James is a
prominent member of the Society for Psychical Research, and no one is
better able than he to give descriptions of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>psychic phenomena; but the conclusions he comes
to as to the spiritual signification of some of them will strike the
normal man as too absurd to be taken seriously. More than this.
Indirectly he furnishes one of the very best weapons for attacking
supernaturalism that has ever yet been put in the hands of the
naturalist. I have already given some examples of so-called religious
experiences (in Chap. II., pp. 59&ndash;61). These are still regarded
by the superstitious as spiritual manifestations; but Professor James
discovers a spiritual interpretation in still more palpable
hallucinations. Unwittingly he spoils the case for religious experience
by trying to prove too much. I will give an instance. He describes how
an intimate friend of his kept experiencing a &ldquo;horrible
sensation&rdquo; of the presence of something, which he &ldquo;did not
recognise as any individual being or person.&rdquo; Professor James
admits that &ldquo;such an experience as this does not connect itself
with the religious sphere.&rdquo; [Why not? It might have been the
Devil that time.] Later on his friend had a pleasanter experience.
&ldquo;There was not a mere consciousness of something there, but,
fused in the central happiness of it, a startling awareness of some
ineffable good. Not vague either&mdash;not like the emotional effect of
some poem or scent or blossom or music, but the sure knowledge of the
close presence of a sort of mighty person; and, after it went, the
memory persisted as the one perception of reality. Everything else
might be a dream, but not that.&rdquo; Professor James then remarks:
&ldquo;My friend, as it oddly happens, does not interpret these later
experiences theistically, as signifying the presence of God.&rdquo; Why
oddly? The explanation seems simple enough. It was just because his
friend was not odd, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span>but a normal individual of modern times.
Perhaps, after all, the secret lay in the well-known reply to the
question, &ldquo;Is life worth living?&rdquo;&mdash;It all depends on
the <i>liver</i>. One may also recall the words of the celebrated
clerical wit who said: &ldquo;They think they are pious when they are
only bilious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor James then relates various experiences of other persons
who, unlike his friend, were positive they <i>had</i> felt &ldquo;the
presence of God.&rdquo; And he tells us: &ldquo;Nothing is more common
in the pages of religious biography than the way in which seasons of
lively and of difficult faith are described as alternating. Probably
every religious person has the recollection of particular crises in
which a direct vision of the truth, a direct perception, perhaps, of a
living God&rsquo;s existence, swept in and overwhelmed the languor of
the more ordinary belief.&rdquo; If this sort of thing accounts for the
faith of every religious person, the mystery (in these days) of the
great faith of the few and the little faith of the many is completely
solved. So few, relatively speaking, have this experience; so few are
by nature mystics. Also it helps to explain the prevalence of
supernatural belief in bygone ages. Thoughtful unbelievers have long
ago come to the conclusion that some such psychical experiences largely
account for religious superstitions, and now an eminent psychologist
and religious apologist confirms their theories.</p>
<p>Professor James argues that &ldquo;the neurotic temperament
naturally introduces one to regions of religious truth which are hidden
from the robust Philistine type of nervous system, that thanks heaven
it hasn&rsquo;t a single morbid fibre in its composition.&rdquo; This
kind of &ldquo;robust Philistine&rdquo; is, one is glad to think, a
very common <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>type. I hope I am a fairly robust Philistine
myself. The Rationalist may, or may not, be emotional, but he certainly
prefers to be without morbid fibres. Why, of all the most undesirable
states of mind, should morbidity assist the human being to have faith
in God? Why should spirituality and strong faith be possible only for a
person of nervous instability whose intellectual canon (unacknowledged
no doubt) is &ldquo;<i lang="la">Credo quia impossibile</i>&rdquo;?
Why, in the name of all that is reasonable, should spiritual
experiences be the prerogative of exceptional temperaments only? Why,
in all fairness, if there be any spiritual meaning in hallucinations,
should not the Agnostic be at least vouchsafed the consciousness of the
Devil&rsquo;s presence to cure him of his unbelief?</p>
<p>Professor James thinks &ldquo;there can be no doubt that as a matter
of fact a religious life, exclusively pursued, does tend to make the
person exceptional and eccentric.&rdquo; He refers to &ldquo;geniuses
in the religious line,&rdquo; who, &ldquo;like many other geniuses ...
have often shown symptoms of nervous instability.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even
more perhaps,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;than other kinds of genius,
religious leaders have been subject to abnormal psychical visitations
... often, moreover, these pathological features in their career have
<i>helped to give them their religious authority and
influence</i>.&rdquo; All this is exceedingly instructive, coming as it
does from the mouth of an earnest champion of religion<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5562src" href="#xd21e5562" name=
"xd21e5562src">42</a> specially suited, by his researches in psychical
phenomena, to speak with authority on the psychology of religion. His
belief in the interference in human life of spiritual agencies, and the
whole tenour of his book, render <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"
href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>it certain that he is not
consciously bringing any arguments to bear against supernaturalism,
but, on the contrary, intends to adduce new arguments in its
favour.</p>
<p>Have we not here a satisfactory and perfectly natural explanation of
the phenomena of conversion? The religionist is apt, I think, to lose
sight of the fact that conversion is not confined to any one particular
creed; that it cannot witness to the truth of the one and not of the
other. &ldquo;The mystical feeling,&rdquo; remarks Professor James (pp.
425&ndash;6), &ldquo;of enlargement, union, and emancipation ... is
capable of forming matrimonial alliances with material furnished by the
most diverse philosophies and theologies, provided only they can find a
place in their framework for its peculiar emotional mood.&rdquo; The
most striking examples of conversion are those of the instantaneous
kind, of which St. Paul&rsquo;s is held out to us as the most eminent.
I have already outlined the probable explanation in St. Paul&rsquo;s
case, and other cases may be similarly explained. The
supernaturalist&rsquo;s interpretation of conversion cannot be
considered seriously until proofs are forthcoming of an instance in
which nothing was known previously of the truth alleged to have been
revealed. Like Mr. Lowes Dickinson, I have never, for example,
discovered a case in which a Mohammedan or a Hindoo, without having
heard of Christianity, has had a revelation of Christian
&ldquo;truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all visions, those of the death-bed especially invite our
attention, for they are looked upon by many pious persons as sure
evidence in favour of the truth of their Faith. Will this argument bear
analysis? We know that good men and women have had heavenly visions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>during their last moments. We know also that
others of equally blameless lives have been terrified at the last by
the sight of some supreme horror. How can any argument be based upon
the phantasms of a disordered brain? Do not these visions, too, usually
take their form from the teaching with which the mind has been imbued?
The Mohammedan sees a heaven peopled with houris; do we on that account
accept the Koran as our guide? A dying Hindoo may have a vision of a
heathen deity of questionable character, and derive comfort from it. I
have myself stood by the bedside of a dying Mahratta whose ravings
during the delirium of fever indicated such a vision. There are, it is
true, cases where the visions of the dying may seem utterly unlike
those we should expect. But the brain retains impressions of things of
which the conscious memory has long ago passed away, and, if the early
history of the ecstatic could be fully known, we should, as Proctor
points out,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5573src" href="#xd21e5573" name=
"xd21e5573src">43</a> find nearly every circumstance of his vision
explained, or at least an explanation suggested. It may be said again
of death-bed visions, as of visions generally, that there has never yet
been a case of a Mohammedan or a Hindoo or any other non-Christian who
has had a revelation of Christian &ldquo;truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor James is not the only person having the curious notion
that an abnormal state of mind admits the nearer presence of God. To
take a people possessing a marvellous self-control over their emotions,
and, therefore, the last among whom you would expect to find such
ideas, I may mention that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>more ignorant and
superstitious among the Japanese throw themselves into hypnotic
trances, and then fondly imagine that a god is present in their body,
and is making use of them as a mouthpiece.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5583src" href="#xd21e5583" name="xd21e5583src">44</a> Again, no
superstition is commoner among the ignorant natives of India,
Mohammedan and Hindoo alike, than that people of unsound mind have some
sort of special means of communication with God; but that educated
persons, having fairly normal minds themselves, should hold such an
opinion is yet another example of the hallucinations to which religious
enthusiasts are liable.</p>
<p>The folly of attributing any spiritual significance to these
experiences will be better understood if we compare them with cases
where there is no religious element whatsoever. A lady, a friend of
mine, is continually subject to a curious experience, which may serve
to illustrate this point. I give the account of it in her own
words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">As a child I was always a bad sleeper, and got into
the habit of making up stories to amuse myself when lying awake in bed.
This habit continued as I grew older; but, after a time, the stories
ceased to be connected in any way with myself. Years ago I began a
story which has grown gradually through three generations, and there
are signs of the coming of a fourth. The old house has remained as the
centre of the story for years; most of the characters are men, and no
one of either sex bears any possible relationship to me. They have all
become far more real to me than my own relations; at bed-time, on long
railway journeys (sometimes), or when I am walking or doing needlework,
they are there. If I get to the house at bed-time, I sleep well. If I
am there when travelling, I don&rsquo;t get tired, and the characters
grow and develop quite naturally. It is my inner life, and, if I were
given that way, it might become a series of visions. <i>I can quite
understand men having ecstasies in which the ideals they have always
before them become apparently materialised.</i></p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PRAYER.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I cannot too strongly insist that all this is
extremely instructive. It explains so many things that still have to be
explained, if religion be untrue. The new science of psychology has
already accounted for many abnormal phenomena that were formerly
considered miraculous&mdash;&ldquo;faith cures,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5604src" href="#xd21e5604" name=
"xd21e5604src">45</a> for instance. Does it not account for the effects
of prayer? We know nothing of the efficacy of prayer in securing
material benefits&mdash;there is no proof either way; but we do know
that it has often an ethical value, and is also a means of
strengthening faith. Does it necessarily follow that a Supernatural
Being hears and answers the suppliant&rsquo;s prayers? I think not.
<i>Suggestion</i>, it is now known, exercises an extraordinary
influence over the subjective mind. In prayer auto-suggestion
undoubtedly plays its subtle r&ocirc;le.</p>
<p>Let me give an example of the benign results that may be effected by
<i>suggestion</i> without any appeal to the supernatural. Often a moral
change for the worse in a most estimable person is distinctly traceable
to causes over which he or she had no control, and the physician or
surgeon, having diagnosed the case, proceeds to do his best to bring
about a cure. Where it is some nervous malady, mental therapeutics or
psychic healing is sometimes extremely efficacious.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5615src" href="#xd21e5615" name="xd21e5615src">46</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>Vices and weaknesses are now looked upon by many
in the light of diseases and ailments&mdash;curable, ameliorable, or
incurable, as the case may be. Disease or Devil, the fact remains that
medical treatment may effect a cure even where the patient&rsquo;s
disorder has been brought on by, as we say, his own fault. Dipsomania,
morphinomania, kleptomania, nymphomania, satyriasis, and various moral
perversions may yield to a purely natural treatment, whether it be the
method of a Milne Bramwell (by <i>suggestion</i>) or of Keeley.</p>
<p>When denouncing Mariolatry (in his sermon at the opening of the
Church Congress, October, 1905), the Bishop of London said: &ldquo;It
is not revealed that the cry to any saint or to the Virgin Mary ever
reaches them at all.&rdquo; Apparently, therefore, the Bishop admits
that appeals to the supernatural may be wasted, and this in spite of
the suppliant being very much in earnest. Yet who would be prepared to
say that the Roman Catholic who prays to the Virgin Mary and to
innumerable saints does not derive quite as much benefit from the
process as the Protestant who directs his worship solely to the Holy
Trinity, or the Shintoist who invokes the benign spirits of his
ancestors?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5628src" href="#xd21e5628" name=
"xd21e5628src">47</a> The effect of the suggestion is the same in each
case, and has all the appearance of an answer to prayer.</p>
<p>Again, putting aside abnormal phases of the mind, is it not, as
Ralph Waldo Trine puts it (in his little book, <i>Character Building:
Thought Power</i>), a simple <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>psychological law that any type of
thought, if entertained for a sufficient length of time, will, by and
by, reach the motor tracts of the brain, and finally burst forth into
action? There seems no need for the introduction of a supernatural
hypothesis to explain the moral effect of prayer. So, also, with regard
to faith, it is only natural that the believer, racked with doubt,
should find reassurance in prayer.</p>
<p>The Theist who lays store by the evidence from &ldquo;religious
experience&rdquo; will do well to ponder over the following words of
one of Professor James&rsquo;s critics: &ldquo;Instead of producing
anything that would strengthen the belief in extra-human spirit agents
<i>influencing human destinies</i>, psychology has made intelligible,
conformably to the rest of our organised knowledge, most, if not all,
of the striking phenomena which have been the empirical props of the
popular faith in spiritism, whether Christian or not. We refer to
an&aelig;sthesias, analgesias, hallucinations, monitions, trances, the
sense of illumination in ecstasy, etc., including the facts considered
in Professor James&rsquo; lectures. In making this statement, I do not
forget the work of the Society for Psychical Research. Its achievements
may be declared to have been so far, and without prejudice of the
future, absolutely inconclusive with regard to
spiritism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5643src" href="#xd21e5643"
name="xd21e5643src">48</a> In other words, psychical research, if
conducted by the experimental method and without bias, may be pregnant
with consequences hardly in accord with the hopes of either the
spiritist or spiritualist (in its religious sense). For, should
abnormal phenomena of all kinds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>admit of a natural
explanation, their present obscurity will no longer furnish grounds for
supernatural speculation.</p>

<h4 class="main">THE RELIGIOUS (?) EXPERIENCES OF INTOXICATION.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to Professor James&rsquo;s theory, it is the
person who chances to have a well-developed subliminal life who is
predestined to be saved, for then God will be able to reach him. As
Professor James informs us that &ldquo;nitrous oxide and ether,
especially nitrous oxide, when sufficiently diluted with air, stimulate
the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree,&rdquo; so that
&ldquo;depth beyond depth of truth seems revealed to the
inhaler,&rdquo; the unbelieving Philistine ought to be recommended to
inhale this truth-revealing, and therefore faith-producing, gas. Like
music, it must be meant as an aid to worship. The new beatitude will
then be, as Mr. Leuba remarks, &ldquo;Blessed are the intoxicated, for
to them the kingdom of spirits is revealed!&rdquo; I can quite
understand the interest aroused by Professor James&rsquo;s remarkable
book; but that Theists and would-be Theists should take its chief
conclusion seriously is beyond me&mdash;or, rather, I should say it is
one more proof to me that the inherited capacity for superstition is
still strong within us. We can understand why supernatural beliefs die
hard.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Are our emotions reliable guides, or are they not?
Though the motive-power in our nature, though they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>go
to make up that heart upon which Mr. Fielding so eloquently discourses
in his <i>Hearts of Men</i>, do they not need to be carefully
controlled by reason? Are they not the very same emotions which, in all
but religious matters, are admittedly a fruitful source of
self-deception? Take the emotion excited by music. I know many good
people who think they possess considerable religious feeling, and have
had a religious experience, because they are peculiarly affected by
music, and especially by fine sacred music.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5670src" href="#xd21e5670" name="xd21e5670src">50</a> Similarly,
Dr. Torrey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Glory Song&rdquo; appeals to the untrained
ear of his emotional audiences, and the Salvation band, all out of
tune, elevates the soul of the Salvationist. Yet lower down the scale
of musical culture we find a clash of discordant sounds exciting the
religious emotions of the savage. Is it too much to say that these
&ldquo;experiences&rdquo; differ only in degree from those of the dog
who howls as certain notes affect him? Granted that music, suited to
the taste of the worshipper, is an aid to worship, we have to remember
that there are those whose temperaments are so constituted that they
are more or less unaffected by music&mdash;good, bad, or
indifferent&mdash;and, if the religious feeling evoked be from God, may
we not ask in all reverence: &ldquo;Why should the unmusical be
debarred from this means of feeling His presence? Why should the man
without a note of music in his composition have this much less chance
of eternal salvation?&rdquo; Surely we are not to take seriously and
literally the words of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=

and the effect produced may be beneficial or may be mischievous. But
sexual love appears to me a strange aid to the worship of <i>God</i>;
and persons who really imagine they are nearer Him when in this state
of emotion most certainly deceive themselves. The ascetic who is
debarred from this particular &ldquo;religious&rdquo; experience should
agree with me.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">REVIVALISM.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An examination of religious experiences, however
brief, cannot well omit all mention of the question of revivalism. Has
it an ethical value? Has it a spiritual meaning? To the latter question
the answer of the Church is for the most part in the affirmative. In
his Pentecostal message for Whitsuntide, 1905, the Archbishop of
Canterbury refers, without directly naming them, to the extraordinary
movement of which the young Evan Roberts has been the leader, and to
the preaching of Messrs. Torrey and Alexander in London. &ldquo;To
whatever cause or combination of causes we may attribute it,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;the fact appears to be certain that expression has this
year been given in an unusual degree to a desire for increased
spiritual earnestness in the Christian life.&rdquo; I shall not embark
upon the question of the spiritual signification of revivalism. My
remarks on other religious experiences may be taken to apply here also.
Regarding its ethical value, I fancy most thoughtful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>onlookers will be with me when I say that it is
unadvisable to stir up hysteria in hysterical people just for the sake
of effects, the usefulness of which is extremely
problematical&mdash;effects which, if they benefit a few, are harmful
to the majority, and, in any case, are unlikely to be of a permanent
nature. We have it on excellent authority that &ldquo;emotional appeals
and revivals do not destroy carnal sin in schools, and it is well known
how often they seem to stimulate, to increase,
immorality.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5693src" href=

<h3 class="main">&sect; 6. <i>The Inevitable Conclusion.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A candid and unbiassed examination of the so-called
theistic proofs can but lead to the one conclusion: they are worthless.
Even if the cosmological and teleological arguments were satisfactory,
and even if &ldquo;religious&rdquo; experiences proved the existence of
a spirit world, the ethical argument undoubtedly breaks down, carrying
along with it all that fragile structure of which the theist&rsquo;s
theories are composed. Yes, the problem of evil is insoluble. &ldquo;We
have not,&rdquo; says John Stuart Mill,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5706src" href="#xd21e5706" name="xd21e5706src">52</a> &ldquo;to
attempt the impossible problem of reconciling infinite benevolence and
justice with infinite power in the Creator of such a world as this. To
attempt to do so not only involves absolute contradiction in an
intellectual point of view, but exhibits to excess the revolting
spectacle of a Jesuitical defence of moral enormities.&rdquo; The
latest defence by an approved apologist of the Church of England will
be found in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>chap. xiv. of <i>Pro Fide</i>. It has been
conducted with conspicuous candour, and such harsh terms as
&ldquo;Jesuitical&rdquo; and &ldquo;revolting&rdquo; are no longer
applicable. Whether, however, this is likely to prove any more
successful than previous attempts, and to serve as an antidote to
scepticism, may be seen by a glance at the following summary of the
line of argument. The author relies, to begin with, upon the
theological assumption that moral evil arises from the abuse of
God&rsquo;s gift to man of a free will. He also argues that the
transmission of a tendency to sin is not unjust, because a remedy for
it has been provided. As for physical evil, this, he maintains,
subserves important moral purposes in the case of man, and in the case
of animals it is more than compensated for by physical good. In the
end, however, he is forced, as we have seen, to fall back upon the
hypothesis of a personal devil. In other words, he presents us with
those sophistical arguments of theistic apologists which we have been
investigating, and then, finding, as a perfectly honest mind must find,
that these are inadequate, he has, after all, to rely upon those
ancient theological dogmas which owe their origin to the insolubility
of the problem. Let those accept his special pleading who can. There
are many who read an apologetic work with minds already made up to be
persuaded by it, and where there is this bias there cannot be straight
thinking. For those who keep an open mind the conclusion is inevitable:
apart from the revelation which has been called in question there is no
proof, there never can be any proof, of the existence of the God of the
Christian. If there be a First Cause, if there be a Supreme
Intelligence, if there be a Deity at all, we know nothing of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=

regard to us.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch6.7">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">NOTE ON RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An examination of the development of philosophy leads
to conclusions of considerable import. Our present inquiry can be only
an exceedingly rapid one; but anyone wishing to study the subject a
little more fully will find it concisely treated in a book called
<i>Science and Faith</i>, by Dr. Paul Topinard, late General Secretary
of the Anthropological Society of Paris. From Chapter VIII. I cull the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Animals, in the presence of phenomena which they do not
understand, retire confounded. Savage man does the same. But he, at
least, hazards the attempt of an explanation by investing the objects
or phenomena in question with life and sentiments similar to his own.
Later this same savage, discovering or believing to discover in himself
a double being, the one corporeal and the other spiritual, transfers
the new notions regarding himself to objects without himself, to
stones, plants, animals, or stars.... Religions, at first more or less
elementary, with their founders and priests, do not appear until
later.... For a long time the sorcerer&mdash;that is to say, a man less
credulous than the rest, and adroit in the sense of knowing how to reap
personal advantage from the beliefs of his fellows&mdash;stood alone in
his class. Sorcerer and medicine man at once, he distributed amulets,
drove out spirits from the bodies of the deceased, and caused the rains
to fall.... The sacerdotal caste arose, at times recruiting itself from
the outside and at times hereditary. More intelligent than the others,
more disposed to reflect, the priests were naturally inclined to seek
more satisfactory explanations from the phenomena of nature, to
distinguish general causes from particular causes, to reduce the number
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>of the spirits, to champion the most important
of these, and even to symbolise many of them. The cult of heroes, of
personages in the tribe who had rendered it valuable services, and of
ancestors, was mingled with the preceding beliefs. Having to speak to
simple people, for whom it was necessary to materialise things, they
were obliged to recast their ideas and to expound them by the help of
fables and myths, which soon essayed to explain in a tangible form the
origin of things, the existing phenomena of nature, and often to guide
the conduct of men. These were the first attempts of philosophy,
already as utilitarian as they were mystical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religions consecrated a multitude of usages and ceremonies
from which the sacerdotal class lived, and which greatly augmented its
power; and they also exerted a strong political influence. Again, they
led up to genuine moral codes, such as those of Brahma and Buddha in
India, and Confucius in China.... The utilitarian idea appears to have
dominated among the Ph&oelig;nician and Canaanite peoples. It gave rise
to the doctrine of a personal national God, who had created man and the
people whom he had chosen and whose destinies he directed. He exacted
from them blind and exclusive worship and obedience to the laws which
he promulgated. In return he protected them, reserving his right of
terrestrial punishment.... The Egyptians are related to the Hindus by
their belief in metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls from
animal to animal.... The conception of a judgment after death passed
through these peoples [the Egyptians] to the polytheism of Greece and
Rome.... Greek philosophy rose audaciously to the loftiest and boldest
conceptions, not conceptions crowning an intellectual edifice, but
conceptions which dominate it in imaginary realms of space. Aristotle
belongs apart. He is at once scientist and philosopher. He observes
nature. He is the founder of natural history, of anthropology, of
political science, and of political economy. According to Graef, he is
also the founder of political philosophy, because he was the first to
introduce positive facts into philosophy.... In the general run, they
[the Greek philosophers] were dialecticians, sophists, and intellectual
gymnasts only. But, such as they were, they founded free inquiry,
disintegrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>the national polytheistic beliefs, and prepared
the way for the revolution which was on the verge of
accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an unknown [?] corner of Jud&aelig;a, on the banks of a
lake, the glad tidings burst forth of a coming regeneration, and a
voice was heard pleading the cause of the feeble, the humble, and the
oppressed, and saying: &lsquo;Love ye one another!&rsquo; The doctrine,
at first local and inculcated by a small number of apostles, soon
extended with St. Paul to the Gentiles, and thenceforward its progress
was rapid [?]. Philosophy was not indifferent to it.... Christianity,
in effect, instead of conquering the pagan world, was conquered by it,
as Huxley has remarked.... During the Middle Ages science had
disappeared from the West. Philosophy, hemmed in between metaphysics
and theology, became scholasticism, which sought to reconcile Plato,
Plotinus, and Aristotle with the needs of orthodoxy, and split hairs
over subtle essences and entities.... Then a concourse of circumstances
occurred which, as fifteen centuries before, was to transform the
Western world, although differently, and which inaugurated modern
times, to wit: The return to the West of the knowledge that had taken
refuge among the Arabs; the discovery of printing, which spread
everywhere trustworthy texts; the discovery of the New World, which
quadrupled the surface of the earth to be observed and studied; the
awakening of science, with Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Rondelet,
Vesalius, Harvey; and, finally, the Reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the downfall of scholasticism the first care of philosophy
was not the renouncing of what had been its essence, the search for the
absolute by <i>intuition</i> [italics are mine] and reason, but the
overhauling of its methods, which it sought to render more precise....
The subsequent divergencies were rooted less in the varying
intellectual and logical make-up of each philosopher and in their
method of applying their faculties than in their individual ways of
feeling and conceiving. Philosophy in effect is simply a struggle
between these elements.... Nevertheless, the conquests of science began
to make themselves felt. There was now less insistence on God and more
on the world, man, morals, and the conditions of social life. The
over-hanging metaphysical cloud is still more or less heavy, but at
spots it suffers the light to pass through. There are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>two
streams: the one continues Descartes&mdash;in France with Pascal,
Bossuet, F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, and Malebranche, in Germany with
Spinoza and Leibnitz; the other, in England, is represented by Bacon,
Hobbes, and Locke.... Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke are the inaugurators of
a school which is characterised by its practical spirit, its
observation and analysis of psychological facts, and by its disposition
to refer the conduct of man to the advantages which he draws therefrom.
It led to Adam Smith, who discovers the sanction of morality in the
public approbation of what is right; to Bentham, who sees it in
interest rationally understood; to Hume and the Scottish school; and
finally to the existing school of John Stuart Mill, Darwin, and Herbert
Spencer. Locke, on the other hand, is also the starting-point of the
French school of the eighteenth century, which is characterised by a
tendency at once anti-clerical, altruistic, and sentimental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall say nothing of the philosophy of the nineteenth
century of the German school, which represents speculative philosophy,
and the English, which is physiological in bent, and of which we have
the highest opinion. In France the most notable achievement is the
attempt which was made by Auguste Comte. For Comte metaphysics must be
entirely eliminated. The day of intuitions, <i>&agrave; priori</i>
conceptions, entities, innate ideas, is past. If a problem cannot be
solved, it is to be let alone. Psychology is only a branch of
physiology, and the latter a division of biology. Morals rest not upon
any imperative obligation, but upon the altruism which education
developes. There are no rights besides those which society confers.
<i>Human knowledge has passed through three stages: one of faith or
theology, one of conceptions or metaphysics, and one of observation or
science.</i> These, in turn, are the basal principles of science, and
would be perfect if the positivist school were faithful to them. But in
its own bosom even there are refractory spirits who suffer themselves
unconsciously to be ruled by their sentiments rather than by
observation, and who are constantly lapsing back into the old
methods.... For me there is but one method of knowing what is, and of
inducing therefrom what has been and what will be&mdash;and that is
observation; all suggestions which transgress this method are
void.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>From his examination of the evolution of philosophy Dr. Topinard
draws, by way of <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>, the following
conclusions:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Philosophy, like religion, is the outcome of the belief in
the supernatural held by man in his more or less primitive state.</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The philosophic spirit and the spirit which created the
arts and letters have as common characters their subjectivity, their
need of imagining and of constructing, and their firm belief in the
reality of their conceptions.</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Philosophy is opposed to science. It answers to the
impatient need of man to explain at once things which elude his
comprehension.</p>
<p><i>d.</i> At the present day philosophy still lives, but is losing
its initial character and sees itself obliged more and more to reckon
with science and practice.</p>
<p><i>e.</i> We are obliged to admit that the group of human faculties
which has given birth to philosophy has a less prolonged future than
the group which has given rise to science.</p>
<p><i>f.</i> Philosophy, although on the wane, and apparently in
disaccord with the end of the nineteenth century, has nevertheless a
beautiful domain to exploit.</p>
<p>These conclusions concerning the past and present of philosophy
cannot be disseminated too widely. So many refuse point-blank to
inquire into their belief, because they have been led to think that
this will entail their wading through a mass of philosophical writings,
and because they expect to find these either incomprehensible or
unconvincing. Properly speaking, Christians should be the first to
admit that apologists who attempt to defend their Faith by abstruse
arguments are sadly inconsistent. For it is written, Jesus rejoiced in
spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes. Let the humble truth-seeker take heart.
Whatever the value or present tendency of philosophy may or may not be,
the truth about the Christian religion can be ascertained without a
knowledge of metaphysics.</p>
<p>Metaphysics does not, and never will, appeal to the average man. He
agrees with the scoffer, who says: &ldquo;When <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>the
man who is speaking no longer knows what he is talking about, and the
man who is listening never knew what he was talking about, that is
metaphysics!&rdquo; The obscurity inherent in profound and abstract
philosophy may well be objected to, not only as painful and fatiguing,
but as the inevitable source of uncertainty and error. &ldquo;Here,
indeed,&rdquo; exclaims Hume, in his essay on <i>The Different Species
of Philosophy</i>, &ldquo;lies the justest and most plausible objection
against a considerable part of metaphysics, that they are not properly
a science, but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human vanity,
which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to the
understanding, or from the craft of popular superstitions, which, being
unable to defend themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling
brambles to cover and protect their weakness.&rdquo; It is accurate and
just reasoning like that of Hume, in his <i>Inquiry Concerning Human
Understanding</i>, which, to quote his words again, &ldquo;is the only
catholic remedy, fitted for all persons and all dispositions; and is
alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon
which, being mixed up with popular superstition, renders it in a manner
impenetrable to careless reasoners, and gives it the air of science and
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be urged that the famous Scottish philosopher and historian
has been unduly severe in his sceptical views concerning speculative
philosophy, or that he would have been less severe upon the later
metaphysical thinking which was affected by his criticisms. There still
remains, in any case, one feature common to all philosophies: their
difficulty. Philosophy is only studied, and, indeed, can only be
thoroughly understood, by the few. Take, for example, that intellectual
phenomenon, Hegelianism, the spirit and method of which have leavened
the whole mass of philosophical thought in Germany. It is confessedly
one of the most difficult of all philosophies. One has heard what Hegel
himself is supposed to have said: &ldquo;Only one man ever understood
me, and even he couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; This difficulty of comprehension
has an important bearing on the argument for Agnosticism. Granting that
there is such a God as Hegel would have us accept, how can anyone
suppose for a moment that a Deity wrapping Himself up in such obscurity
would be unreasonable enough to expect all mankind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>to
believe in Him? He must not only pardon, but approve of, Agnosticism. A
God, whose existence can only be proved, if it can be proved at all, by
the abstruse arguments of a Hegel, is not a God anxious to reveal
Himself to His creatures. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href=

<h3 class="main">&sect; 1. <i>Preliminary Remarks. The Power of
Christianity for Good.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Finally we have to consider some arguments that have
often quite as much weight with the believer as Bible apologetics or
Theistic proofs. They are: (1) The power of Christianity for good; (2)
the marvellous spread of Christianity; (3) the witness of the Christian
martyrs; and (4) the universality of the religious instinct. The first
of these&mdash;the power of Christianity for good&mdash;opens up a
large question, and I have thought it advisable, therefore, to select
for special investigation two popular beliefs springing from this
source&mdash;namely, the belief that woman owes her present position to
Christianity, and the belief that the overthrow of Christianity would
endanger society and the nation. The point now under consideration is
not whether Christianity <i>ought</i> to have been, but whether it
<i>has</i> been, a power for good. Although the apologist, when hard
pressed as to this or that evidence of failure, attributes it to the
fault of man, he nevertheless continues stoutly to maintain that
Christianity has indeed worked wonders for mankind. This we should
certainly expect of it, if it be a true belief, and it is a claim
therefore which cannot be too closely investigated. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>It would be a comparatively easy, though lengthy, task to make out
an exceedingly strong case against Christianity by enlarging upon the
inhumanity and immorality of the Dark Ages, and comparing this with the
far more humane and moral conduct of men in pre-Christian
civilisations. One could point to the rock-graven edicts of King Asoka
(263&ndash;226 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>), and show that in the
matter of discountenancing slavery, of humanity to prisoners, of
denouncing war, of founding hospitals, of abolishing blood sacrifices,
of inculcating religious toleration, and of teaching purity of life,
all that is now so complacently claimed for Christianity was
anticipated. Or again, one might dwell on the dark side of Christendom,
even in this year of grace 1907, and draw some very odious comparisons,
especially as we have so recently been presented with the object-lesson
of a heathen race which excels many, and equals any, of the Christian
races in nearly all those virtues we prize and call Christian. But I
have no intention of embarking upon such a wide sea of controversy.</p>
<p>One controversial subject, however, I feel bound to notice, because
the disputed point is at the root of the whole matter. We are so
accustomed to hear every humane or unselfish deed, and every moral act,
described as Christian that &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; have almost become synonymous terms. It never
occurs to us to ask, or we never give a second thought to the question,
how much the humane principles now accepted among civilised nations may
be due to education, experience, and evolution, and how much to
Christian influence. The Rationalist attributes the improvement chiefly
to the former, and, in any case, to the working of natural forces; the
Christian chiefly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275"
name="pb275">275</a>]</span>to the latter, and, in any case, to the
working of supernatural forces.</p>
<p>All that is beneficial in civilisation, both on its material and on
what is called its spiritual side, is placed by the Christian to the
credit of Christianity, and the hand of God is traced with becoming
reverence in every discovery which ameliorates our lot. This, although
the promoters and discoverers are often non-Christians, and although it
is well known that it is the Church that has chiefly delayed the
advance of science. Whatever may be the case now, the education of the
masses never concerned her in olden times. Rather her concern was then
that the people should not be educated, much as it is in Russia at the
present time. Such education as she did encourage was of the type
imparted in the Mohammedan University at Cairo to-day&mdash;the three
R&rsquo;s and the Koran&mdash;and for similar reasons. As late as 1846
Cobden writes to a friend on the subject of national education:
&ldquo;I took the repeal of the Corn Laws as light amusement compared
with the difficult task of inducing the priests of all denominations to
agree to suffer the people to be educated.&rdquo; Again, Lord Macaulay,
speaking of the Roman Catholic Church, in the first chapter of his
<i>History of England</i>, says that &ldquo;during the last three
centuries to stunt the growth of the human mind has been her chief
object. Throughout Christendom, whatever advance has been made in
knowledge, in freedom, in wealth, and in the arts of life, has been
made in spite of her, and has everywhere been in inverse proportion to
her power. The loveliest and most fertile provinces of Europe have,
under her rule, been sunk in poverty, in political servitude, and in
intellectual torpor.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>So long as organisms are adapted to their environment, neither
progressive nor retrogressive development will occur. Because, after
the Dark Ages, Europe progressed while Asia stagnated and Africa
retrogressed, is modern civilisation to be placed to the credit of the
Christian religion? As rationally might any one of the ancient
civilisations be credited to the popular superstition of the country
then in the van of progress. To such absurd lengths are these
pretensions carried that we find persons ignorant enough and fanatical
enough to attribute the present predominance of Christian nations to
their religion. For a reply to such I cannot better that given by a
learned Buddhist monk to a missionary who had told him that nations of
the West had become powerful because of their Christianity. &ldquo;The
fact is,&rdquo; retorted the monk, &ldquo;that nations have become
powerful in the degree to which they have rejected the precepts of
Christianity, in the extent to which they have substituted for the
Christian maxim of &lsquo;Love thy neighbour as thyself&rsquo; that
other maxim which shoots 300 bullets a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the only contention really worth considering, let us
assume that there has been moral progress in Christendom, and let us
assume also that this has nothing to do with the advance of
Humanitarianism in the present, or with pre-Christian (Buddhist, for
instance) teaching in the past. Are we to conclude that this is a proof
of the divine origin of Christianity? I must confess I fail to see how
any improvement which there may be in the matter of coarse vice among
the proletariat, of dishonesty among the commercial classes, of
corruptness among the professional, and of sensuality among the
leisured classes, can be any proof that Jesus, one of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>world&rsquo;s reformers, was God Incarnate.
Christian teaching embodies precepts of the greatest ethical value,
borrowed, as we now know, from the doctrines of ancient moralists and
religious teachers. Would it not indeed be strange if this teaching had
done no good whatever&mdash;if the leaven had had no elevating
influences at all, whereas the teachings of Confucius and Buddha have
produced those admirable results which even Christians are at last
prepared to admit? Dr. Warschauer explains in <i>Anti-Nunquam</i>, p.
72, that Agnostics are good men, &ldquo;because, willingly or
unwillingly, they have taken in Christian ideas through every
pore.&rdquo; How, then, does he explain the virtues of the
Japanese?</p>
<p>Let us now leave generalisation, and investigate in some detail an
important Christian argument which has the contention of
Christianity&rsquo;s power for good as its source. It forms a striking
illustration of the way fallacies may arise from a hard-and-fast
adhesion to convictions that are justified rather by the heart than by
history.</p>

<p class="first">The majority of women still remain true believers.
There appear to be numerous reasons, psychological and educational, for
their attitude. Woman is more imaginative, more emotional, and more
sensitive to external <i>suggestion</i> than man. As to her education,
men, even those who have no religious belief whatever, prefer to keep
her in ignorance of their views, partly under a vague notion that
unbelief would undermine her virtue and lessen her amiability, and
partly because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>they deem her religious influence an essential
element in the upbringing of their children. In addition to all this,
woman is taught by the Church that Christianity is her best friend.
Prominent prelates of the Church proclaim that &ldquo;the Gospel has
given woman the position she holds to-day.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5866src" href="#xd21e5866" name="xd21e5866src">2</a> Nothing
could very well be more contrary to fact. One can only suppose that
these expounders of the truth are speaking according to the dictates of
their hearts, and without having really studied the question, or else
that they believe their cause is served by deliberately closing their
eyes to inconvenient facts. The question is one of supreme importance,
as it is chiefly women who are now the mainstay of the Faith.</p>
<p>People with little or no knowledge of those portions of history that
specially bear upon the question are easily deceived. The average
woman&rsquo;s ideas concerning the pre-Christian civilisations are
decidedly vague. Her ideas may also be further confused by lurid
accounts from the pulpit of the licentiousness prevalent among the
upper classes during the earlier and also the last years of the Roman
Empire; while nothing is told her about the unrestrained licence of the
aristocracy during the Middle Ages, and the degraded condition of the
masses during, say, the eighteenth century, &ldquo;when,&rdquo; says
Sir Walter Besant, &ldquo;for drunkenness, brutality, and ignorance,
the Englishman of the baser kind reached the lowest depth ever reached
by civilised man.&rdquo; Clerics who unconsciously mislead their
congregations with this argument cannot be aware of those hard facts of
history which render it untenable. For their benefit, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>and
for the benefit of their dupes, let us glance at a few of these
facts.</p>
<p>The status of women among the &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; is vouched
for by the Romans, their enemies, and therefore unexceptionable
witnesses. Nothing impressed the Romans more than the equality of the
sexes among the northern nations, the man&rsquo;s reverence for
womanhood, the woman&rsquo;s sympathy with manhood, and the high code
of morality that was the natural outcome of this well-balanced state of
society.</p>
<p>At a time when the men of the &ldquo;Chosen People&rdquo; were
insulting and unjust to their women, heathen women enjoyed a position
which their Christian, not to mention their Mohammedan, descendants
might well envy. &ldquo;Polygamy only began to disappear among the Jews
in the fifth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, and so curious was
the influence of the Old Testament on the early Christian Church that
several of the Fathers could not bring themselves to condemn it, and it
was not officially suppressed by the Church until <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1060. Luther and the Reformers allowed it even later.
Yet polygamy was one of the surest signs of a contempt of woman, and it
had been rejected by Greeks, Romans, and barbarians long before the
Hebrews began to perceive its enormity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5886src" href="#xd21e5886" name="xd21e5886src">3</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The part women played in old Japan,&rdquo; writes the founder
of the first university for women in Japan,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5894src" href="#xd21e5894" name="xd21e5894src">4</a> &ldquo;was
very remarkable, especially <i>before</i> the arrival of Buddhism and
Confucianism. Men and women were almost equal in their social position.
There was then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>no shadow of the barbarous idea that men were
everything and women nothing. Women&rsquo;s power even in politics was
great, and history tells us that there were nine women who ascended the
throne in olden times. Women in general were not inferior to men
physically, mentally, or morally. They were noted for their bravery,
and distinguished themselves on the field of battle. In the literary
world they were not less noted for their brilliant productions. Their
moral conduct was most blameless, and commanded universal respect.
Their natural temperament was cheerful and optimistic, and charmed the
sterner sex. Such being the attainments and characteristics of women in
olden times, we can fairly believe that they were as well educated as
men were, although there were not existing any institutions of
instruction for women. This was the springtime of Japanese womanhood,
when it blossomed undisturbed, and exerted a strong and beneficial
influence on the life of old Japan. The introduction of Buddhism and
Confucianism, however, began to create great changes in the position of
women. And yet so powerful were women in society when these two
religions came to Japan that their rapid spread in our country was due
to the earnest endeavours of women.&rdquo; Speaking of the feudal age,
he remarks: &ldquo;The social environment of the age and the prevalence
of Buddhism and Confucianism worked hand in hand to bring about the
subjection of women.&rdquo; The analogy between the experiences of the
Japanese lady and her European sister is a striking one. (There is an
analogy, too, between the conduct of the Buddhist priests and that of
the Roman Catholic priests in the Middle Ages, or even in Southern
Italy to-day. &ldquo;The sins of the present generation of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>priests,&rdquo; said Count Okuma in the course
of an interview, &ldquo;are many, and the hells about which they preach
are prepared for the like of them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5907src" href="#xd21e5907" name="xd21e5907src">5</a> &ldquo;The
majority of the priests are utterly degenerate and hopelessly
ignorant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5914src" href="#xd21e5914"

<p>Look on these pictures, one of 2000 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> and
the other of <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1850:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Picture I.</i>&mdash;Two thousand years before the Christian era
&ldquo;woman was more free and more honoured in Egypt than she is in
any country of the world to-day. She was the mistress of the
house.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5933src" href="#xd21e5933" name=
"xd21e5933src">7</a>... She inherited equally with her brothers, and
had full control of her property. She could go where she liked, or
speak with whom she liked. She was &lsquo;juridically the equal of
man,&rsquo; says M. Paturet, &lsquo;having the same rights and being
treated in the same fashion&rsquo;; and the same authority observes
that it was not as mother, but as woman, as a being equal in dignity,
that she was thus honoured. There was polygamy in theory, but the first
wife was generally able to exact conditions in her marriage contract
which effectually prevented it. The inscriptions show, says
Masp&eacute;ro, that she remained to the end of her life &lsquo;the
beloved of her husband and the mistress of the
house.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5936src" href=
"#xd21e5936" name="xd21e5936src">8</a></p>
<p><i>Picture II.</i>&mdash;In enlightened Boston, about 1850 (under
the English Common Law), woman could not hold any property, either
inherited or earned. A woman, either married or unmarried, could hold
no office <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>of trust or power. She was not recognised as a
citizen. The status of a married woman was little better than that of a
domestic servant. By the English Common Law her husband was her lord
and master. He had the sole custody of her person, and of her children
while minors. He could punish her &ldquo;with a stick no thicker than
his thumb,&rdquo; and she could not complain against him. He was the
owner of all her real estate and of her earnings. She had no personal
rights, and could hardly call her soul her own. Her husband could steal
her children, rob her of her clothing, neglect to support the family:
she had no legal redress.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5946src" href=
"#xd21e5946" name="xd21e5946src">9</a></p>
<p>Not until near the middle of the nineteenth century did that
movement commence which has radically improved, and will continue to
improve, the position of women. And who took the chief, and, in the
initial stage, the only, part in this reform movement?
<i>Freethinkers.</i> Who were silent when they were not active
opponents? <i>The clergy.</i> &ldquo;It was just those who most
radically abandoned Christianity&mdash;Owen, Holyoake, and
Mill&mdash;that were the most logical and ungrudging in their plea for
woman. It was the Mary Wollstonecrafts, Harriet Martineaus, Frances
Wrights, George Eliots, Helen Taylors, and Annie Besants that
distinguished themselves by fearlessness and unselfishness... The
clergy never discovered any injustice to woman; and only one in a
thousand could see it when it was pointed out.... All honour to the
memory of those clergymen who, like Kingsley and Farrar, protested
against the injustice to the full extent of their idea of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>womanhood.... On the Continent there has been
the same story of general clerical opposition and general heterodox
support.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5965src" href="#xd21e5965"
name="xd21e5965src">10</a> &ldquo;Mr. Pinchwife,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5970src" href="#xd21e5970" name=
"xd21e5970src">11</a> too, has undoubtedly had a hand in the subjection
of woman; but we are investigating the grounds for the contention that
Christianity has laid on woman a burden of gratitude, and that, if
Christianity were overthrown, women would sink into unknown depths of
degradation. Do the above-stated facts bear out that contention?</p>
<p>The question arises: Why has Christianity stood in the way of
woman&rsquo;s cause? The answer is simple enough: Christianity, in
adopting the Old Testament, adopted with it the Hebrew conception of
woman. Her inferiority to man was established by her origin from his
<i>rib</i> and the leading part she took in his <i>fall</i>. The Vicar
of Crantock tabulates<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5987src" href=
"#xd21e5987" name="xd21e5987src">12</a> the reasons why a Christian
woman should cover her head in church, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">(1) Man&rsquo;s priority of creation. Adam was first
formed, then Eve.</p>
<p>(2) The manner of creation. The man is not of the woman, but the
woman of the man.</p>
<p>(3) The purport of creation. The man was not created for the woman,
but the woman for the man.</p>
<p>(4) Results in creation. The man is the image of the Glory of God,
but woman is the glory of man.</p>
<p>(5) Woman&rsquo;s priority in the Fall. Adam was not deceived; but
the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression.</p>
<p>(6) The marriage relation. As the Church is subject to Christ, so
let the wives be to their husbands.</p>
<p>(7) The headship of man and woman. The head of every man is Christ,
but the head of the woman is man.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Jews&rsquo; idea of a woman was sanctioned by no less an
authority than Jehovah; nor did the Christ of the Gospels give one word
of clear guidance on this or any other social problem, or enter one
word of explicit protest against the injustice of the Judaic treatment
of women. Again, the teaching of St. Paul was based on the Old
Testament, and the teaching of the Fathers was based on the Old
Testament and St. Paul. A few quotations from the sayings of some of
these Fathers, whose contempt of marriage became one of the great
errors of the Church, may prove instructive:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Fornication is a lapse from one marriage into
many.&mdash;<i>Clement of Alexandria.</i></p>
<p>Digamists (widowers who re-marry) are saved in the name of Christ,
but are by no means crowned by him.&mdash;<i>Origen.</i></p>
<p>Second marriage is &ldquo;a decent sort of
adultery.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athenagoras.</i></p>
<p>It was no part of God&rsquo;s primitive design that the race should
be continued by sexual union. Marriage is the outcome of
sin.&mdash;<i>St. Gregory of Nyssa</i> (a married bishop).</p>
<p>Blessed is the one who leads a celibate life, and soils not the
divine image within him with the filth of concupiscence.</p>
</div>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Fierce is the dragon, and cunning the asp;</p>
<p class="line">But woman has the malice of both.</p>
</div>
<p class="first signed">&mdash;<i>St. Gregory of Nazianzum.</i></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Why was woman created at all?&mdash;<i>St.
Augustine.</i></p>
<p>Thou art the devil&rsquo;s gate, the betrayer of the tree, the first
deserter of the divine law!</p>
<p>Marriage is not far removed from
fornication.&mdash;<i>Tertullian.</i></p>
<p>She is more fitted for bodily work.... Remember that God took a rib
out of Adam&rsquo;s body, not a part of his soul, to make her.</p>
<p>She was not made to the image of God, like man.&mdash;<i>St.
Ambrose.</i></p>
<p>Woman is the root of all evil.&mdash;<i>St. Jerome.</i></p>
<p>At the Council of Auxerre, in 578, the bishops forbade women, on
account of their &ldquo;impurity,&rdquo; to take the sacrament in their
hands as men did.</p>
</div>
<p>If women only knew of these sayings, would they approve of the
&ldquo;appeal to the first six centuries&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Bad as the position of woman was under the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>influence of the early Church teaching, it was,
in many respects, still worse during the Middle Ages. &ldquo;Life-long
seclusion in the inner apartments of the house of a man she has not
chosen, or internment in a nunnery&mdash;that is, either degraded or
unnatural&mdash;is the choice (within limits) of the daughter of the
wealthy. Life-long drudgery, with few and coarse pleasures, with a long
vista of sticks and whips, and scold&rsquo;s bridles, and ducking
stools&mdash;with, perhaps, the brutal &lsquo;ordeal&rsquo; on the
slightest suspicion, or the ghastly death of the witch, is the prospect
of the daughter of the poor.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6078src"
href="#xd21e6078" name="xd21e6078src">13</a> Even the Reformation
altered more than it improved the condition of woman. How could it be
otherwise when the Reformers were nothing if not Bibliolaters?</p>
<p>Of the movement for the betterment of woman&rsquo;s position that
eventually took place, not by the aid, but in spite, of the Church, I
have already spoken. All the evidence we possess regarding the history
of Heathendom and Christendom conclusively shows that Christianity has
done much to lower, and but little to elevate, the position of women.
Should I have succeeded in arousing the interest of my gentle readers,
or should they wish to verify my statements, I implore them to read
well-known works of competent authorities on this subject. The
astounding but apparently prevalent idea, that woman is only secured by
Christianity from the brutal assaults of man, will appear in the next
argument we are about to consider. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286"

<h3 class="main">&sect; 3. <i>The Overthrow of Christianity would
Endanger Society and the Nation.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have elsewhere commented on the opinion prevalent in
England (and in some other, but not all other, Christian countries)
that, to quote Canon Henson, &ldquo;the real elements of the Christian
Faith are those that have made European nations the most powerful in
the world,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6097src" href="#xd21e6097"
name="xd21e6097src">14</a> and that the overthrow of Christianity would
endanger the nation. Many go still farther, and prophesy absolute
chaos. People who have been imbued with the Church&rsquo;s teaching,
and who have spent their lives in Christian surroundings, are naturally
convinced that belief and morality are indissoluble partners&mdash;that
Christianity is a power for good in this respect above all others.
Therefore, when Professor Flint says, &ldquo;It [the Christian Faith]
could not be displaced without shaking society from top to
bottom,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6103src" href="#xd21e6103"
name="xd21e6103src">15</a> he expresses a very popular opinion among
believers and semi-believers. Even among Agnostics there are many who,
while recognising the fallacy so far as they themselves are concerned,
still seem to consider that society would be insufficiently protected
from criminals by its own instinct of self-preservation, and that, to
maintain order among the masses, the hand of the law must, for the
present, be strengthened by appeals to a supernatural sanction of
conduct. Both Herbert Spencer and Matthew Arnold, for example, thought
the world at large stood in peril of a moral collapse, while, as the
latter puts it, &ldquo;the old (theologically-derived) sanction of
conduct is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>out of date, and the new is not yet born.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Few things can happen more disastrous,&rdquo; writes Herbert
Spencer, &ldquo;than the decay and death of a regulative system no
longer fit, before another and fitter regulative system has grown up to
replace it&rdquo; (see Preface, dated July, 1879, to <i>The Data of
Ethics</i>). It is for reasons such as these that so many Agnostics
still lend their moral support to the Churches; for men rightly uphold
what they deem essential to the common weal, whether it be
Christ-worship in England or ancestor-worship in Japan.</p>
<p>This deeply-rooted conviction regarding belief and conduct has been
partially considered in the first section of this chapter, and, the
subject being one of the greatest importance, I am also devoting to its
consideration a portion of the concluding chapter of this book. I shall
confine myself here to the warning given to us by the Church and the
pious laity&mdash;that we must expect nothing less than chaos should
the Resurrection, and along with it, of course, the whole fabric of
Christianity, be ultimately disproved.</p>
<p>This view has been illustrated in Mr. Guy Thorne&rsquo;s book,
<i>When it was Dark</i>. The book may be seen on every bookstall, has
had an extraordinary sale,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6120src" href=
"#xd21e6120" name="xd21e6120src">16</a> and has been much appreciated
by many pious-minded persons (especially by those of the High Church
persuasion, the book being written by a partisan of that cult). The
anti-Christian propagandist is here represented as <i>knowing</i> that
Christ is God; but, for some unexplained and exceedingly mysterious
reason, utilising a huge fortune and a powerful intellect in
unscrupulous endeavours to spread disbelief. He is a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>deceiver of mankind, a genuine Satan in human
shape. He leads the life of an ascetic, so the usual grounds given for
disbelief are removed. With the assistance of another man (a real
villain, this time, of the lowest type), <i>one of the greatest savants
of the day</i>, a gigantic fraud is perpetrated, and the Resurrection
thereby definitely disproved. Immediately an epidemic of crime breaks
out among <i>quondam</i> Christians, which nothing can quell. The
restraints of order are paralysed, and the criminal element is rampant.
The violence and viciousness of <i>men</i> were, please to note,
specially directed against the weaker sex, who had to keep at home and
bar the door. Not only Agnostics, but any who happened to differ in
their views from this champion of Christianity, come in for a share of
Mr. Thorne&rsquo;s invective. The wonder is how an author of his
ability could be capable of penning such an effusion; and that it can
be read and appreciated, as it undoubtedly has been by many excellent
persons of his way of thinking, only shows how easily bias may cloud
the intellect. It requires an effort, too, to understand how this book
can appeal to one of the chief dignitaries of the Church; but there,
conspicuously printed on the cover, we are treated to an extract from
his sermon in praise of the book.</p>
<p>I submit that there is not a Rationalist in the world, however
militant, who would descend to forgery to promote his cause. He would
not hold the <i>pious</i> opinion that the end justifies the means. On
the contrary, the curtain has but now fallen upon a scene where a
Christian Church ranged herself on the side of forgers while
freethinkers like Zola and Cl&eacute;menceau fought the battle of
truth.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Guy Thorne and the admirers of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>his
book, the Christian races are innately far worse than Jews, Turks,
infidels, and heretics&mdash;far worse, indeed, than savages and
animals&mdash;for they are only held in check from the commission of
the vilest excesses by their belief in the Resurrection. Chaos and
crime are rife in certain cities in Russia and Poland to-day. What is
the cause? Unbelief? Is it not rather the result of the cruel laws and
despicable methods of a Christian government, aided by Christian
butchers, calling themselves soldiers, and by a Christian hooligan
element such as it would be hard to find outside a Christian city? This
chaos occurs, mind you, under a powerful Christian theocratic
government; and the head of the Holy Synod, Pobiedonostseff, was,
before his removal, one of the prime movers. The terrible atrocities of
which the unfortunate Jews have been the victims were undoubtedly
connived at by the authorities, and inhuman crimes have been
perpetrated by Christians that would be impossible in humane Japan. The
policy of keeping the masses steeped in the grossest superstitions of
the orthodox Church is now bearing fruit, adding to the chaos and
bloodshed and hindering the work of reform. It is belief, not unbelief,
that has played a leading part in creating this chaos, and in stirring
up man&rsquo;s cruellest passions.</p>
<p>As to the safety of women (in the event of the Resurrection being
discredited), where in civilised Christendom, may I ask, could a lady
be left for days and nights alone in a tent or open house? She
<i>can</i> be, in the Indian jungle or in the Australian bush. For such
protection as may there be necessary (and the open house testifies how
little it is required) she relies upon her heathen servants. Almost the
only danger in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>India is from religious fanatics, and in
Australia from Christian criminals. In what Christian country would it
be safe to have paper windows and walls, as in Japan? My wife and I
slept in strange, out-of-the-way native hotels in Japan in perfect
security, though a would-be criminal had only to tear through a thin
piece of paper! Belief in the Resurrection is rapidly decaying in
France to-day. Are cases of assault on women any the more prevalent on
that account? If belief in the Resurrection is so essential, how comes
it that we have allied ourselves to a heathen nation, and made friends
with another that is fast giving up this belief? How comes it that in
our own Government two of the most responsible posts are now occupied
by declared Agnostics?</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;What, then,&rdquo; asks the Rev. Prebendary W.
A. Whitworth,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6161src" href="#xd21e6161"
name="xd21e6161src">17</a> &ldquo;was the original gospel of power
which overran the world with such astonishing success?&rdquo; The
spread of Christianity is thought by nearly all good Christians to have
been marvellous. Was it? That is the question we have next to consider.
In the first place, let us see what we are told on this point by
recognised theologians. In his book, <i>The Bible in the Church</i>, we
are reminded by the learned Dr. Westcott, the late Bishop of Durham,
that the dispersion of the Jews exercised a great influence upon the
spread of Christianity. &ldquo;The pagans got the idea of monotheism,
while the Jews themselves dropped the idea of a &lsquo;kingdom&rsquo;
and substituted a &lsquo;faith.&rsquo;&rdquo; He also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>reminds us of the broad unity of the Roman
Empire, and of the dispersion of the Jews being co-extensive with its
limits, and concludes that &ldquo;during the lifetime of St. Paul every
condition was realised for proclaiming the Gospel to the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Without such preparation,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the spread of
Christianity would be <i>historically inconceivable</i>, and it is a
remarkable example of Divine Providence.&rdquo; Here, then, we have an
admission of purely natural causes, and, although the believer may be
able to look upon them with reverence, as Providential, he can hardly
claim them to be at the same time a witness to the power of the Gospel.
Also, we shall see that there were many other natural causes at work,
and that among them were some which the pious would be the last to
connect with a Divine Providence.</p>
<p>Historians find that the rapidity of the spread has been much
exaggerated, and that it was not until the Emperor Constantine convened
the Council of Nic&aelig;a in <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 325 that the
spread commenced to emerge from insignificance. Even then the adhesion
to the new Faith was for a long period of a purely nominal character,
the unwilling converts remaining, to all intents, pagans after they
were baptised. The spread of Christianity was for a long time confined
to cosmopolitan trading towns only, the villagers remaining
pagans&mdash;hence the name. (<i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, it is the
villagers who are now the last to be touched by the spread of
&ldquo;paganism.&rdquo;) What were the &ldquo;Providential&rdquo;
methods of conversion? The prevailing ignorance and superstition were
taken advantage of by the propagators of the Gospel and frauds freely
perpetrated, while &ldquo;edicts of toleration removed the temporal
disadvantages which had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>hitherto retarded the progress of
Christianity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6185src" href=
"#xd21e6185" name="xd21e6185src">18</a> After the Emperor Constantine
had been converted, &ldquo;the cities which signalised a forward zeal,
by the voluntary destruction of their temples, were distinguished by
municipal privileges, and rewarded with popular
donations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6191src" href="#xd21e6191"
name="xd21e6191src">19</a> When these measures failed, Church and State
had recourse to persecution, quite as cruel as, and on a scale that far
exceeded, the persecution of the early Christians by the heathen. For
instance, the Emperor Theodosius, at the suggestion of the
ecclesiastics who governed his conscience, promulgated, in the space of
fifteen years (<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 380&ndash;394), &ldquo;at
least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics, more especially
against those who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6202src" href="#xd21e6202" name=
"xd21e6202src">20</a> Buddhism, on the contrary, unlike Christianity
and Mohammedanism, was promulgated without persecution or religious
wars, and spread far more rapidly than Christianity. In his apologetic
work, <i>Anti-Theistic Theories</i>, Dr. Flint refers to Buddhism thus:
&ldquo;The very marvellous system of thought called Buddhism, which
originated in India about 500 years <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, has
spread over a greater area of the earth and gained more adherents than
even Christianity, and by peaceful means&mdash;by the power of
persuasion&mdash;not by the force of arms, not by
persecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why did the Emperor Constantine embrace Christianity? Was it not
mainly because he believed that it had a power to wipe away his own
heinous crimes?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6217src" href="#xd21e6217"
name="xd21e6217src">21</a> Even his old age &ldquo;was disgraced by the
opposite, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=

prodigality.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6225src" href=

Faith, he put off his baptism till he was on his death-bed, in order

asked to look upon as a prototype of Christ and His prime ancestor.</p>
<p>On all these matters of history the learned Bishop Westcott is
silent, although, as examples of Divine Providence, they would appear
sufficiently remarkable. Lest Gibbon&rsquo;s testimony be deemed
untrustworthy on account of his anti-Christian bias, the following
extract from a prize essay in Christian apologetics may be noted. Not
only does it bear out some of the historian&rsquo;s statements
concerning the causes of the spread of Christianity, but it discloses
the significant fact that the clergy increased their power and
influence by working upon the emotions of wealthy women, and that
&pound;.s.d. and its female contributors were then, as now, a <i lang=
"la">sine qua non</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6242src" href=
"#xd21e6242" name="xd21e6242src">24</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Nine years after
the conversion of Constantine to the Christian faith he promulgated
that great edict which, more than any other enactment, may be said to
have lain at the foundation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>of clerical power during the
ensuing centuries, and relieved the Christian Church from that
restriction under which, in common with the Jews, they had so long
laboured&mdash;the incapacity of profiting by the testamentary
liberality of their wealthy proselytes. To convince us of the abundance
in which the stream of wealth flowed into the newly opened channel, and
of the influence obtained by the clergy, in those days as in the
present, over the piety and pliability of the weaker sex, more
especially at Rome, we possess not only the testimony of a Pagan
historian,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6247src" href="#xd21e6247" name=
"xd21e6247src">25</a> but the less suspicious evidence of an edict
published by the Emperor Valentinian<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6250src" href="#xd21e6250" name="xd21e6250src">26</a> fifty years
after that of Constantine, addressed to Damasus, Bishop of that city,
and imposing a limit to the extravagant donations of females. The
clergy, moreover, might look for an increase of worldly substance not
only from the prosperity of their friends, but from the downfall of
their enemies; for the Theodosian code contains a series of stringent
enactments by the Emperor Honorius,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6256src"
href="#xd21e6256" name="xd21e6256src">27</a> in terms of which not only
the deserted temples of Paganism, but even the meeting-houses and
possessions of Donatists, Manich&aelig;an, and other heretical
corporations, were made over to the Catholic Church.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6259src" href="#xd21e6259" name=
"xd21e6259src">28</a></p>
<p>There was yet another, and possibly the chief, cause for the
ultimate spread of Christianity. In the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>chapter on
comparative mythology I have described and commented upon the various
rationalistic theories concerning the origins of Christian beliefs and
ceremonies. As a matter of fact, Mithraism spread just as much, or
more, until Christianity obtained the necessary political power to
suppress it. Not only from these anti-Christian theories, but also from
the admissions of apologists concerning them, it appears that
Christianity gained ground, not so much because there was something new
either in its dogma or in its promise, but rather because these were so
closely paralleled in many pagan cults. Let us take, for example, the
spread of Christianity in Egypt. &ldquo;The Egyptians who embraced
Christianity found that the moral system of the old cult and that of
the new religion were so similar, and the promises of resurrection and
immortality in each so alike, that they transferred their allegiance
from Osiris to Jesus of Nazareth without difficulty. Moreover, Isis and
the child Horus were straightway identified with Mary the Virgin and
her Son.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6269src" href="#xd21e6269"
name="xd21e6269src">29</a> &ldquo;The knowledge of the ancient Egyptian
religion which we now possess fully justifies the assertion that the
rapid growth and progress of Christianity in Egypt were due mainly to
the fact that the new religion, which was preached there by St. Mark
and his immediate followers, in all its essentials so closely resembled
that which was the outcome of Osiris, Isis, and Horus that popular
opposition was entirely disarmed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6274src" href="#xd21e6274" name="xd21e6274src">30</a> We have,
then, here one of the main factors in the growth of Christianity. I
cannot find that Bishop Westcott recognises this as a part of the
preparation in which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>hand of God can be traced; but
advanced apologists very largely do so now, and hence the precious
theory of progressive revelation.</p>
<p>We may now pass on to another very popular argument.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 5. <i>The Noble Army of Martyrs.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My allusions to religious persecutions may remind some
of my readers of the experiences of the early Christians, and of the
witness to the truth of Christianity furnished by the &ldquo;noble army
of martyrs&rdquo;; and they may say: &ldquo;Admitting that there be
nothing extraordinary in the mere fact of Christianity&rsquo;s spread,
you must allow that its power over men&rsquo;s minds is little, if at
all, short of miraculous. Men could not have given their lives for a
falsehood.&rdquo; This argument will not bear the slightest scrutiny.
&ldquo;Steadfastness under persecution says much for the sincerity, and
still more for the tenacity, of the believer, but very little for the
objective truth of that which he believes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6289src" href="#xd21e6289" name="xd21e6289src">31</a> Supposing
the noble army were a historical fact, the argument based upon it would
be adequately met by pointing to the last Ghazi who ran amok in the
hope of a speedy delivery from a dirty and ugly spouse on earth, and of
reaping the reward of a clean and lovely houri in heaven.</p>
<p>But the noble army is not altogether a historical fact. The truth is
that martyr-making became an ecclesiastical industry. The historian
Gibbon estimates that at most about two thousand Christians fell in the
Diocletian persecution&mdash;which was the only general
persecution&mdash;and this estimate is now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>commonly accepted. &ldquo;Since,&rdquo; says
Gibbon, &ldquo;it cannot be doubted that the Christians were more
numerous, and their enemies more exasperated, in the time of Diocletian
than they had ever been in any former persecution, this probable and
moderate computation may teach us to estimate the number of primitive
saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the important purpose
of introducing Christianity into the world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6299src" href="#xd21e6299" name="xd21e6299src">32</a> Compare
these figures with the numbers who have suffered death in modern times
for the sake of introducing a non-Christian faith. The Bab Abbas
Effendi suffered martyrdom for his zeal in 1850, and between that date
and now the most conservative opinion on the Babi martyrdoms puts them
at ten thousand. (N.B.&mdash;No hopes of wealth and honours, no
imperial edicts, have assisted the really remarkable spread of Babism.)
As a matter of fact, a considerable portion of the history of man is a
history of his martyrdom. &ldquo;Our own prosperity is founded on the
agonies of the past.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6311src" href=
"#xd21e6311" name="xd21e6311src">33</a> If religious ladies could spare

Man</i>, a book none the less interesting because it treats of

continue, or appear to continue, to believe in God and immortality, is
considered by many to furnish the best proof for the truth of the
belief. The Church naturally encourages this opinion, and proceeds to
strengthen it further by asserting that the religious instinct is, and
always has been, universal. This assertion must now be examined, and,
to avoid any misconceptions, it will be advisable in the first place to
have some specimens of it before us.</p>
<p>Canon Liddon informs us that &ldquo;man is ever feeling after
God,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the thought of God is always latent in the
mind of man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cicero&rsquo;s statement that there is no
nation so barbarous and wild as not to have believed in some divinity

universal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6347src" href="#xd21e6347"

<h4 class="main">THE RATIONALIST&rsquo;S CONTENTION.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Rationalist asks: What grounds have we for
assuming that the existence of religious belief points to the existence
of a religious instinct? Is not a man&rsquo;s religion determined by
the geographical accident of his birth? Has not his religion to be
diligently instilled into him from the cradle? How, then, can it be
said that man is by nature religious? How can it be said that the
craving for a deity is instinctive? To this the Christian apologist may
reply that, however much the precise form of the religious belief may
be due to education, no belief of any kind could be engendered without
a predisposition to accept it. Have we not seen, however, that
primitive beliefs were the natural offspring of fear and wonder?
Inability to account for phenomena, ignorance of the laws of nature,
and those abnormal psychical experiences concerning which science has
but now commenced to furnish natural explanations, all combined to turn
primitive men into staunch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href=
"#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>supernaturalists. For the same
reasons, children in years as well as children in knowledge have always
been predisposed to belief in the supernatural. This predisposition (it
can hardly be called an instinct) may be universal, but it does not
lead necessarily to belief in a deity. For that there must be
education. If it be an instinct, it is not a religious instinct,
although a soil eminently suitable for the sowing of supernatural
dogmas.</p>
<p>Admitting, for the sake of argument, that the origin of religious
beliefs and the process by which ancestral beliefs have been
assimilated can be left out of consideration&mdash;in other words, that
the ethnologist&rsquo;s theories of the evolution of the idea of God
and the educational factor may be disregarded&mdash;the supposition
that there is a universal religious instinct must be relinquished if,
as the Rationalist contends, religious belief itself is not universal.
Is such a contention warranted by acknowledged facts? Into this we
shall now inquire.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch7.6.3">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE APOLOGIST&rsquo;S VIEWS CONCERNING SUPERSTITION
AND THE RELIGIOUS INSTINCT.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the outset of the inquiry we at once experience a
difficulty. It is not at all clear what the apologist includes under
the category of religious beliefs. If it be taken as an axiom that the
grossest superstition, the mere belief in the supernatural, is the germ
of a religious belief, and therefore that all ignorant or superstitious
persons have the religious instinct, then the proposition will be true
for practically the whole of mankind in the remote past, and for a very
large proportion in the present. Whether it be primeval man who
frequently believed only in magic, usually in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>devils, and rarely in divinities, or whether it
be the twentieth-century lady of fashion who wears a white elephant
amulet to bring her luck at &ldquo;Bridge,&rdquo; both are imbued with
the religious instinct. The absurdity of the supposition is fully
apparent if we only carry it far enough.</p>
<p>It is by no means easy to understand where the apologist draws the
line. He may not say so, but his contention really does seem to point
to the absurdity that almost any crude superstition springs from a
divine spark. The neo-apologist, however, will do well to reflect that
the establishment of any connection between superstition and religion
only plays into the hands of the Rationalist, who maintains that there
is certainly the closest connection between the two. I am compelled to
enter into these details, for, among the facts which I am about to
bring forward in contradiction of the assertion of universality, some
relate to instances of pure superstitions which might nevertheless be
construed into signs of the religious instinct. If the apologist does
not go quite so far as this, my task will be rendered much easier.
Perhaps, as Dr. Flint is recognised as one of the most eminent of the
Christian apologists, the conclusions to which he comes will represent
the unspoken opinion of others. He says that, &ldquo;if savage tribes
have some sort of superstitious belief, it would only be in accord with
modern theories regarding the evolution of the idea of God.... The
presence of false religion is as good evidence of the existence of
religion as the presence of true religion.... Perhaps, if we may say
that religion is man&rsquo;s belief in a being or beings mightier than
himself and inaccessible to his senses, but not indifferent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>to his sentiment and actions, with the feelings
and practices which flow from such belief, we have a definition of the
kind required, one excluding nothing which can be called religion, and
including nothing which is only partially present in
religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6390src" href="#xd21e6390"
name="xd21e6390src">40</a> This definition would not, one may presume,
include mere belief in magic, but might be taken to include a
man&rsquo;s belief in devils. As there are many who would not agree
that devil-worship and the like can have any connection with
god-worship, I shall follow the ethnologist in citing examples of the
absence of god-worship as evidence of the absence of the religious
instinct; but I shall also give examples in which there is no
appearance of worship either of god or devil. These will chiefly be
drawn from present-day beliefs and customs, because now, if ever, the
contention of the religionist should hold good, and also because it has
been incidentally examined with reference to ancient beliefs in a
previous chapter.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">BELIEFS OF SAVAGE MAN.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the concluding remarks of Darwin&rsquo;s
<i>Descent of Man</i> we read: &ldquo;The belief in God has often been
advanced as not only the greatest, but the most complete, of all the
distinctions between man and the lower animals. It is, however,
impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or
instinctive in man. On the other hand, a belief in all-pervading
spiritual agencies seems to be universal, and apparently follows from a
considerable advance in the reasoning powers of man, and from a still
greater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>advance in his faculties of imagination,
curiosity, and wonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief
in God has been used by many persons as an argument for His existence;
but this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe
in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, possessing only a
little more power than man; for the belief in them is far more general
than the belief in a beneficent Deity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6406src" href="#xd21e6406" name="xd21e6406src">41</a></p>
<p>Again, in Huxley&rsquo;s essay on &ldquo;The Evolution of
Theology&rdquo; we read: &ldquo;In its simplest condition, such as may
be met with among the Australian savages, theology is a mere belief in
the existence, powers, and disposition (usually malignant) of
ghost-like entities who may be propitiated or scared away; but no cult
can properly be said to exist. <i>And in this stage theology is wholly
independent of ethics.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Lubbock, now Lord Avebury, states the argument against the
universality of religion in his <i>Prehistoric Times</i>. He asks:
&ldquo;How can a people who are unable to count their own fingers
possibly raise their minds so far as to admit even the rudiments of
religion?&rdquo; And he sums up his observations on various tribes by
saying: &ldquo;Indeed, the first idea of God is almost always an evil
spirit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6421src" href="#xd21e6421"
name="xd21e6421src">42</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea that the northern tribes [of America] venerated one
supreme and all-powerful &lsquo;great spirit,&rsquo; by whom man and
the world were created, is based on erroneous interpretation;
<i>Wakanda</i> of the Dakotas, and <i>Manito</i> of the Algonquins, in
no wise coming under such a designation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6432src" href="#xd21e6432" name="xd21e6432src">43</a>
&ldquo;These terms,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href=
"#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>writes Mr. W. J. McGee,
&ldquo;cannot justly be rendered into <i>Spirit</i>, much less into
<i>Great Spirit</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6447src" href=
"#xd21e6447" name="xd21e6447src">44</a> &ldquo;Their religion,&rdquo;
writes another well-known ethnologist, Mr. G. Mooney, &ldquo;is
zootheism, or animal-worship, with the survival of a still earlier
stage, which included the worship of all tangible objects, combined
with the beginnings of a higher system in which the elements and the
great powers of nature are deified.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6452src" href="#xd21e6452" name="xd21e6452src">45</a> Zootheism,
the religion that has survived, does not embrace a belief in a Mightier
Being, nor does this deterioration in &ldquo;religion&rdquo; suit the
theory of a progressive revelation. We may also note that the belief of
the North American in witchcraft has led to terrible slaughter, human
life being sacrificed on an enormous and frightful scale.</p>
<p>Andrew Lang (in the third chapter of his book, <i>Magic and
Religion</i>) instances Australian tribes, and says: &ldquo;Nobody
dreams of propitiating gods or spirits by prayer [compare Bishop
Ingram&rsquo;s statement that man is a <i>praying</i> animal!] while
magic is universally practised.&rdquo; There is, as Mr. Lang observes,
&ldquo;no room for a God, nor for an idea of a future life, except the

<p>Similarly among the Fuegians (another of the lowest races of

<p class="first">&ldquo;Wherever sympathetic magic occurs,&rdquo; says
Dr. Frazer, &ldquo;in its pure unadulterated form, it assumes that in
nature one event follows another necessarily and invariably <i>without

"xd21e6502src">50</a> &ldquo;come to agree with Sir A. C. Lyall and Mr.
F. B. Jevons in recognising a fundamental distinction, and even
opposition, of principle between magic and religion.&rdquo; This
opinion must be shared by every unbiassed mind, and it is curious, and
not without importance, to observe, with Dr. Frazer, that the
&ldquo;fundamental conception&rdquo; of sympathetic magic &ldquo;is
identical with that of modern science.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6508src" href="#xd21e6508" name="xd21e6508src">51</a>
&ldquo;Underlying the whole system is a faith&mdash;implicit, but real
and firm&mdash;in the order and uniformity of nature.&rdquo;<a class=

"#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>The belief in the efficacy of magic, it should be remembered, is
exceedingly widespread, even at the present time. According to Mr.
Haddon<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6521src" href="#xd21e6521" name=
"xd21e6521src">53</a> (citing Dr. Jevons), &ldquo;four-fifths of
mankind, probably, believe in sympathetic magic.&rdquo; Dr. Frazer,
too, reminds us that among the ignorant and superstitious classes of
modern Europe it is very much what it was thousands of years ago in
Egypt and India, and what it now is among the lowest savages surviving
in the remotest corners of the world. &ldquo;If the test of
truth,&rdquo; exclaims Dr. Frazer, &ldquo;lay in a show of hands or a
counting of heads, the system of magic might appeal, with far more
reason than the Catholic Church, to the proud motto, &lsquo;<i lang=
"la">Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</i>,&rsquo; as the sure
and certain credential of its own infallibility.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6530src" href="#xd21e6530" name=
"xd21e6530src">54</a></p>
<p>Not only is there an opposition of principle between magic and
religion, not only is belief in the former a universal faith, a truly
catholic creed, but it is now generally recognised by ethnologists that
&ldquo;in the evolution of thought, magic, as representing a lower
intellectual stratum, has [as &lsquo;has been plainly suggested, if not
definitely formulated, by Professor H. Oldenberg in his able book,
<i lang="de">Die Religion des Veda</i>&rsquo;] probably everywhere
preceded religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6540src" href=
"#xd21e6540" name="xd21e6540src">55</a></p>
<p>The popular notion that the religious instinct is universal is
perhaps natural enough, but it is not borne out by these significant
facts and conclusions. Indeed, it would be far more correct to say that
an instinct, the very antithesis of what the Church <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=

<h4 class="main">RELIGION IN MODERN CHINA.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So far we have seen that the opponents of the
&ldquo;Universal&rdquo; theory presume in their argument that
devil-worship has no relation to true god-worship, and we may note that
it never even entered the heads of such men as Darwin and Lubbock that
it would ever be held that these are essentially identical. Nor is this
peculiar opinion held by clerics who have studied devil-worship on the
spot. Thus the Rev. Arthur H. Smith, D.D., twenty-two years a
missionary in China, describes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6555src"
href="#xd21e6555" name="xd21e6555src">56</a> the fear of goblins and
devils which figures so largely in Taoism; but, far from suggesting the
presence of the religious instinct, he laments its total absence. Among
his many pertinent observations I commend the following to the serious
consideration of those who believe in a universal religious instinct
and in a progressive revelation: &ldquo;<i>If the Chinese ever did
recognise the true God, that knowledge has certainly been most
effectually lost</i>, like an inscription on an ancient coin now
covered with the accumulated rust of millenniums.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6564src" href="#xd21e6564" name="xd21e6564src">57</a>... Sir
Thomas Wade, whose long familiarity with China and the Chinese might be
supposed to entitle him to speak with authority on so plain a question
as whether the Chinese have or have not a religion, has recently
published his opinion as follows: &lsquo;If religion is held to mean
more than mere ethics, I deny that the Chinese have a
religion.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6569src" href=
"#xd21e6569" name="xd21e6569src">58</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese nature-worship, Dr. Smith says: &ldquo;<i>No
prayer</i> is uttered.... What is it that at such times the people
worship? Sometimes they affirm that the object of worship is heaven and
earth. Sometimes they say that it is heaven, and again they call it
&lsquo;the old man of the sky.&rsquo; The latter term often leads to an
impression that the Chinese do have a real perception of a personal
Deity. But when it is ascertained that this supposed person is
frequently matched by another called &lsquo;grandmother earth,&rsquo;
the value of the inference is open to serious question.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6582src" href="#xd21e6582" name=
"xd21e6582src">59</a></p>
<p>As to there being no such thing as an atheistic people, are we to
take no account of the cultured classes? Mark the following: &ldquo;The
polytheism and pantheism of the lower classes of Chinese are matched in
the upper classes by what appears to be <i>pure atheism</i>....
<i>There never was on this earth a body of educated and cultured men so
thoroughly agnostic and atheistic as the mass of Confucian
scholars.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e6594src" href="#xd21e6594"
name="xd21e6594src">60</a>... Its absolute indifference to the
profoundest spiritual truths in the nature of man is the most
melancholy characteristic of the Chinese mind&mdash;its ready
acceptance of a body without a soul, of a soul without a spirit, of a
spirit without life, of a cosmos without a cause, <i>a universe without
a God</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6604src" href="#xd21e6604"
name="xd21e6604src">61</a></p>
<p>Alluding to the mixture of Confucianism with Taoism and Buddhism, he
remarks: &ldquo;Any kind of a divinity which seems adapted to exert a
favourable influence in any given direction will be patronised, just as
a man who happens to need a new umbrella goes to some shop where they
keep such goods for sale. To inquire into the antecedents of the
divinity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>who is thus worshipped no more occurs to a
Chinese than it would occur to an Englishman who wanted the umbrella to
satisfy himself as to the origin of umbrellas, and when they first came
into general use.... The Chinaman has carried &lsquo;intellectual
hospitality&rsquo; to the point of logical suicide, but he does not
know it, and cannot be made to understand it when he is
told.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6615src" href="#xd21e6615"
name="xd21e6615src">62</a></p>
<p>Three questions suggest themselves. If the pious lady who
contributes towards mission work in China only knew of this, would she
be pleased?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6622src" href="#xd21e6622" name=
"xd21e6622src">63</a> Are there not many English people strangely like
the Chinese in an umbrella-patronage of Christianity? Finally, does not
the modern apologist (with his theory of Progressive Revelation and his
idea that Christianity has yet much to learn from, and will be improved
by contact with, the faiths of the East) carry &ldquo;intellectual
hospitality&rdquo; to the point of logical suicide?</p>
<p>The advice of Confucius was to reverence the gods as if they
existed,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6633src" href="#xd21e6633" name=
"xd21e6633src">64</a> but in any case to keep them at a distance, and
have as little to do with them as possible; and his advice has been
followed. Dr. Smith tells us that the popular instinct has taken at its
true value the uncertainty conveyed in the words &ldquo;as if,&rdquo;
and has embodied them in current sayings which accurately <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>express the state of mind of the mass of the
people. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Call on the gods as if they came;</p>
<p class="line">But, if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And again:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Worship the gods as if the gods were there;</p>
<p class="line">But, if you worship not, the gods don&rsquo;t
care.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6650src" href="#xd21e6650" name=
"xd21e6650src">65</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The absence of the instinct of reverence may be judged
by the following episode related by Dr. Smith: &ldquo;A District
Magistrate tried a case which involved a priest, and, by implication,
the Buddha which was the occupant of the temple. This <i>god</i> was
summoned to appear before the magistrate and told to kneel, which he
failed to do, whereupon the magistrate ordered him to be given five
hundred blows, by which time the god was reduced to a heap of dust, and
judgment was pronounced against him by default.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6660src" href="#xd21e6660" name=
"xd21e6660src">66</a> (Of their manner of treating <i>devils</i> I had,
not long ago, a personal experience. Standing on the quay at Shanghai,
I was deafened by the bang, bang, bang of ear-splitting bombs exploded
by a crowd of Chinamen. However crude their method, their intentions
were excellent. They wished to scare away the devils who might have
elected to accompany their friends on the voyage to England.)</p>
<p>Finally, as a commentary on the oft-repeated assertion that the
great difference between the sacred books of the East and of the Bible
is the low plane of morality in the former, the following words quoted
by Dr. Smith are of considerable interest: &ldquo;No people,&rdquo;
says Mr. Meadows, &ldquo;whether of ancient or modern times, has
possessed a sacred literature so completely exempt as the Chinese from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>licentious descriptions, and from every
offensive expression. There is not a single sentence in the whole of
the Sacred Books and their annotations that may not be read aloud in
any family circle in England.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6675src" href="#xd21e6675" name="xd21e6675src">67</a> Can this be
said of our Bible?</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">APOSTATES IN CHRISTENDOM.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If I have given the religious attitude of the modern
Chinese the largest share of attention, it must be remembered that they
far outnumber any other nation in the world. Also I think the fallacies
regarding the religious instinct will perhaps stand out more clearly if
we consider the present twentieth century, instead of millenniums
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> I have said nothing as yet of the
apostates in Christendom&mdash;the Darwins, the Huxleys, and the
Spencers&mdash;who declare that they are without the religious
instinct. We must consider them ruled out of court, for are we not
told<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6688src" href="#xd21e6688" name=
"xd21e6688src">68</a> that &ldquo;there are men with faculties of
insight amounting to genius in other regions of mental activity who
have never developed the spiritual faculty, and are thus debarred the
privileges of spiritual geniuses&mdash;geniuses in the region in which
man holds communion with God&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Lately much capital has been made out of the following statement
appearing in Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Autobiography</i>: &ldquo;Up to the age
of thirty or beyond it, poetry such as Milton, Byron, Wordsworth, etc.,
gave me great delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read a
line of poetry. I have lost my taste for pictures and music. My mind
seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>out of large collections of facts.&rdquo; This
loss of certain tastes indicated&mdash;so the pulpit would have the pew
suppose&mdash;that that portion of Darwin&rsquo;s mind which was
competent to understand spiritual things had atrophied. Does God reveal
Himself, then, only or especially to the &aelig;sthetic? The
artist&mdash;and here I include the poet, painter, sculptor, musician,
artistic novelist, and also the man who has created nothing, but who
has the artistic temperament&mdash;will, if he has a religion, have one
of a sort harmonising with his artist soul. It must be a religion which
allows scope for the cultivation of the beautiful, without being
necessarily too closely associated with a rigid code of ethics. Is the
&aelig;sthetic mind always perfectly balanced? How does it compare on
an average with that of the moral philosopher guiding his life by the
light of reason and living up to the standard of his professions?
Darwin has assisted in establishing a great truth concerning the
development of the world. He has been, according to the Christian
evolutionist, the chosen instrument for a fresh revelation of
God&rsquo;s majesty. Yet, in spiritual endowments, every pious
Christian, however ignorant and unintellectual, ranks before him!
Strange, passing strange. The very qualifications necessary for
accomplishing God&rsquo;s purpose debarred Darwin from fellowship with
Him! For such an argument to be worth a moment&rsquo;s consideration it
should at least apply generally. This it most distinctly does not.
Preachers, who find Darwin&rsquo;s candid remark about himself a
convenient one upon which to base a homily, have neglected to acquaint
themselves with the statements of other agnostic scientists&mdash;of
Huxley, for instance. &ldquo;I have yet,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;to
meet with any form of art in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href=
"#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>which it has not been possible for
me to take as acute a pleasure as, I believe, it is possible for men to
take.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6703src" href="#xd21e6703"

<h4 class="main">RELIGION IN MODERN JAPAN.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the risk of increasing the citation of examples
<i lang="la">ad nauseam</i>, I cannot omit a passing reference to the
Japanese. I shall reserve for the last chapter my remarks on the
&ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo; of their non-theological moral training, and
confine myself to the present condition of their faith as given by a
clergyman, the Rev. Herbert Moore, who was for some years a missionary
in Japan. Mr. Moore tells us: &ldquo;We are all Shintoists to a certain
extent, for Shinto is the non-Christian version of the Communion of
Saints. And we recognise the truth that Buddhism contains when we read
Ecclesiastes in church.... But these old faiths are fast perishing from
the hearts of the Japanese, leaving behind them blank godlessness,
indifference, and materialism.... Out of 942 students in Tokyo who
recently gave an account of their religious position, 555 declared
themselves unbelievers in any religion, 68 were Christians, 18
Shintoists, and most of the remaining 319 Buddhists.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6720src" href="#xd21e6720" name=
"xd21e6720src">70</a></p>
<p>Mr. Moore, in chapter xiv. of his book, quotes a summary of the
situation by the <i>Japan Times</i>, which all who are interested in
the question whether Japan is likely to adopt Christianity would do
well to read. As bearing on the particular point we are now discussing,
the following may be noted: &ldquo;We cannot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>believe that it [Christianity] will ever succeed
in getting a firm hold upon the minds of the educated classes. Men of
these classes have for centuries lived and died under a system of
morality which inculcates virtue for virtue&rsquo;s sake, and entirely
dispenses with supernatural sanctions of any sort.... We cannot agree
with those who, like Mr. Toyama and Mr. Fukuzawa, recommend it to their
countrymen, while they themselves refuse to believe in it, except as a
collection of useful superstitions.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h4 class="main">CLASSICAL HISTORY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It matters not where you direct your searchlight, you
cannot fail to discover instance upon instance confuting the pious
assertion of a universal religious instinct. Take the case of the great
Roman poet and philosopher, Lucretius, whose unique poem, <i>De Rerum
Natura</i>, has acquired a new interest in the present day. He set
before himself the task of finally crushing that fear of the gods, and
that fear of death resulting from it, which he regarded as the source
of all human ills. He denied the two bases of all religion (as we
understand it)&mdash;the doctrines of a supernatural Governor of the
world, and of a future life.</p>
<p>I will not continue to multiply examples. It is surely clear that
the religious instinct is <i>not</i> universal. <span class=

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch7.7">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">NOTE ON HUMAN SENTIMENT AS TO A FUTURE LIFE.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What is the Rationalistic explanation of that essence
of the &ldquo;religious instinct,&rdquo; belief in an after life? It
may, I think, be summed up briefly in some such words as these:
&ldquo;The conception of non-existence is an effort beyond the power of
human intellect. As long as man thinks, his ego is fully conscious of
its existence, and not able to grasp the idea of non-existence. Thus
religion is a functional weakness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6757src" href="#xd21e6757" name="xd21e6757src">72</a> The
instinct of self-preservation does the rest; it transforms the
speculation into an ardent desire. &ldquo;The theory of a continued
existence after death is nothing more than a certain manifestation of
the impulse for self-preservation, as the instinct for
self-preservation itself is nothing more than the form under which our
vital energies, that have their seat in every cell of our organism,
manifest themselves to our consciousness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6763src" href="#xd21e6763" name="xd21e6763src">73</a> Is not this
a perfectly natural explanation of the craving for immortality?</p>
<p>This craving, as we have seen, is not universal; while, in Buddhism,
it is assumed that man ought to strive for extinction. Even among
Western nations the craving is not so common as it is generally
supposed to be, and as the Church confidently takes for granted. In
support of this conclusion, I should mention that my readers will find
a startling confirmation in an article on &ldquo;Human Sentiment with
regard to a Future Life,&rdquo; which appears in the <i>Proceedings of
the Society for Psychical Research</i> for October, 1904. The article
is written by a well-known psychologist, Mr. F. C. S. Schiller, Fellow
and tutor of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and author of various
well-known works on the mind (<i>Riddles of the Sphinx</i>, 1891;
<i>Humanism</i>, 1903, etc.). He reviews the results of a laborious
inquiry by the American branch of the S. P. R., and comes to the
conclusion that &ldquo;the returns show a hitherto hardly suspected
weakness of the desire for knowledge of a future life,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6778src" href="#xd21e6778" name=
"xd21e6778src">74</a> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href=
"#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>that, &ldquo;amid all the various
phenomena of human psychology, distress due to uncertainty about
one&rsquo;s fate after death seems to be one of the
<i>rarest</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6789src" href=
"#xd21e6789" name="xd21e6789src">75</a> Mr. Schiller, the apostle of
Professor W. James in this country, shows that he himself possesses the
craving for an after life in no ordinary degree, and this adds all the
more force to his statement that the instinct is in nowise universal.
I, too, once had a craving so intense that hell itself seemed less
awful than total annihilation. To those who have built up high hopes
their destruction must come as a terrible shock&mdash;a shock
eventually relieved by a feeling of resignation to the inevitable.</p>
<p>What we, as anxious parents, have to ask ourselves is: Do we not
agree with St. Paul when he says, &ldquo;If Christ be not risen, then
is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain&rdquo;; and are we
not aware that, with the advance of knowledge, the present widespread
disbelief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ will become more and more
general? Even now how many disbelieve or preserve an agnosticism
regarding the chief dogmas of the Christian creed? How many are
sceptical concerning the continuance of consciousness after death? Does
either science or common sense support a belief in the survival of
personality? Are we right, then, in permitting our children&rsquo;s
minds to be imbued with a &ldquo;sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life&rdquo;? Is it a kind act to expose our
children to the pain of a rude awakening by instilling hopes that are
destined to be ultimately shattered? <i>Is it a wise act to allow their
morality to be based upon foundations that are doomed to
destruction?</i> It is not as if we were forced into telling fairy
stories because we shrink from negative teaching. It is not as if there
were no natural incentives to right conduct, no positive teaching
possible, without an admixture of theological speculations.
Non-theological moral instruction is not only possible, but is urgently
wanted and will be extremely beneficial. This will appear more fully in
the following chapter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=

Pinchwife, it will be remembered, is the anxious husband (in
Wycherley&rsquo;s comedy, <i>The Country Wife</i>) who held that a
woman is innocent in proportion to her lack of knowledge. There are, of
course, other reasons why a wife&rsquo;s ignorance is deemed desirable.

<p class="first">The hostile evidence appears to be overwhelming.
Christianity cannot be true. Provided that we see things as they really
are, and not as we wish them to be, we cannot but come to this
conclusion. Let me recall to the reader&rsquo;s mind the more salient
points.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chapter I.: The Situation.</span>&mdash;All over
Christendom a great conflict has commenced between naturalists and
supernaturalists. The real attitude of the laity, and especially of the
cultured portion of it, is far more sceptical than the clergy imagine,
or, at any rate, are prepared to admit. They do not realise that
agnostics and semi-believers have, not deliberately perhaps, but none
the less really, joined in a conspiracy of silence, either on account
of their conviction of the need for Christianity as a restraint during
the prevalence of ignorance, or on account of their regard for public
and private opinion and vested interests, or last but not least, on
account of sheer indifference. To put it frankly, the Churches have for
their chief ally nowadays the trinity of ignorance, insincerity, and
indifference. Not only is this alliance one which they ought to be the
first to repudiate, but it cannot be depended upon in the near future.
Though a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>mind be built, as it were, in water-tight
compartments, a flood of truth that is strong enough will burst them
open.</p>
<p>Christianity and science are <i>not</i> reconciled. The character of
the present wave of scepticism differs from that of all others in the
history of Christianity or of mankind, in that it has the support of
modern knowledge. It has all the appearance of a wave that will
increase in strength, and finally destroy all the present faiths of the
world. Plenty of &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; agnosticism, of <i>a priori</i>
&ldquo;infidelity,&rdquo; is still to be met with, and of this, as
Professor Huxley once remarked, a man of the calibre of Butler, of the
&ldquo;Analogy,&rdquo; can easily make short work; but the scepticism
of the modern scientist is of another kind. It arises from a mastery of
the laws of Nature. The Christian apologies to meet <i>this</i>
scepticism are unsatisfactory to the last degree. Often they are based
on premises the truth of which is open to the gravest doubt, or they
betray ignorance of established facts. They are also conflicting, so
that the arguments of the advanced and the arguments of the
conservative are mutually destructive, the latter frequently bearing
out the contentions of the rationalist regarding the former. For these
reasons they are totally unconvincing. Meanwhile the main issue of the
conflict is confused and delayed by various side issues, which have
nothing really to do with the question of Christianity&rsquo;s truth.
There is further delay through the currency of a number of popular
fallacies.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chapter II.: Miracles.</span>&mdash;Belief in
miracles is necessary if Christianity be true. The various attempts to
explain miracles are evasions, not solutions of a difficulty, and are
as specious as they are conflicting. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>Few thinkers could
bring themselves to agree with Canon Mason that miracles are no longer
needed because &ldquo;the Holy Spirit, with His eternal freshness of
life, does not cramp Himself by obsolete and antiquated methods of
action.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6837src" href="#xd21e6837"
name="xd21e6837src">1</a> The fundamental miracles are not historical
facts. The evidence for all miracles is totally inadequate. No miracle
has ever occurred.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chapter III.: Modern Bible
Criticism.</span>&mdash;All non-Christian and some Christian
theologians accept the conclusions of the Higher Criticism in their
entirety, while many learned divines accept much that is destructive of
beliefs that have been held for nearly two millenniums. The critics
show that the Bible is not historically true, and explain that
&ldquo;we must turn from external details to the great spiritual truths
which underlie them.&rdquo; As observed by the Dean of
Canterbury,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6847src" href="#xd21e6847" name=
"xd21e6847src">2</a> &ldquo;they only <i>say</i> that they are not
historical; what they <i>mean</i> is that they are not true.&rdquo; The
strictly orthodox and the rationalist are at one in agreeing that
historic truth is essential to Christianity; that Christianity claims
to be built not on ideas, but on facts; and that the far-fetched
explanations of the advanced school cannot be accepted. The
rationalist, however, finds himself forced to admit the validity of the
destructive criticisms, and also finds further grounds for unbelief in
the silence of historians, in the manner in which the alleged
revelation was transmitted, and in those sober facts which so
completely impugn the divinity of Jesus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Chapter IV.: Comparative
Mythology.</span>&mdash;The similarity of beliefs, customs, and
teachings in ancient religions with those in the Christian religion are
as numerous as they are remarkable. These parallels deprive
Christianity of any claim to originality, and furnish an explanation of
its origin which completely destroys our belief in its truth. The
theory of a progressive revelation is the outcome of dire necessity,
for the survival of Christianity depends upon its acceptance. This
theory is for many and cogent reasons quite untenable. It is not, and
cannot be, accepted by the strictly orthodox. The latter endeavour,
therefore, to disprove the closeness of the parallels, or, failing
this, to prove that they are Christian accretions. Enlightened divines,
on the other hand, acknowledge the parallels, and rely upon the theory
of progressive revelation to explain them.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chapter V.: Evolution.</span>&mdash;For the benefit
of those who may be ill-informed on the subject, the theory of
evolution is explained, and convincing proofs of our animal origin are
submitted. The theory is generally accepted by the cultured, though
much ignorance and prejudice concerning it still prevail. The
evolutionary processes are completely at variance with the Bible and
with our ideas of God. The Churches as a body do not accept evolution
willingly, and are chary in acknowledging its truth in their public
utterances. Many of their most distinguished members are, however,
evolutionists, and these profess that evolution is helpful to belief.
Their arguments are singularly unconvincing. The doctrine of the Fall
is untenable.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chapter VI.: Theistic Proofs.</span>&mdash;Many,
honestly deeming themselves to be Christians, are in reality
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>either deists or non-Christian theists. The
recognised arguments for Theism are the evidences of a First Cause, of
design and directivity, and of benevolence. Not one of these is
accepted by more than a very small minority of scientific men. The
evidence of design and directivity is more apparent than real, while,
with regard to benevolence, it would be easier to demonstrate the very
reverse. The evidence from religious experience is another argument,
which has recently been submitted to the cultured, as a final proof of
the existence of the spiritual world. This argument is shown not only
to be full of absurdities, but indirectly to furnish natural
explanations for much that has hitherto puzzled mankind, and led to
belief in the supernatural.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chapter VII.: Popular
Arguments.</span>&mdash;Finally, there are certain popular arguments
which help to confirm the believer, and to determine the friendly
attitude of the average unbeliever. Broadly speaking, they are all
comprised under two main assertions&mdash;Christianity&rsquo;s power
for good, and the universality of the religious instinct. So long as we
confine ourselves to a shallow and biassed examination, the flaws in
these assumptions will pass unnoticed; but when we submit them to a
closer examination, with open minds, we find that they cannot be
substantiated by the facts of either ancient or modern history.</p>
<p>I may be permitted to add that I attach the greatest importance to
the object-lesson now presented to us by Russia and Japan. Not only
have we here an excellent illustration of the fallacies concerning the
power of Christianity and the connection between conduct and belief,
but this illustration has been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322"
href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>given to the whole world.
Among the millions who have watched events, thousands upon thousands
must have some inkling of the place that religion holds in the minds of
these two peoples, and, therefore, must have found much that will cause
them to modify their opinions concerning these popular arguments. I
cannot imagine any other conjunction of circumstances which could have
resulted in such a broadcast sowing of the seeds of scepticism.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Main Conclusion.</span>&mdash;It is customary
in Christian apologetics to palliate the inadequacy of any one
particular argument or set of arguments for belief by reminding us that
we must take into consideration the combined weight of all the other
(equally inadequate) arguments. The apologist of unbelief has no need
to ask this of his readers. On the contrary, he is able to point out a
number of arguments, each of which is, of itself, fully sufficient to
warrant their joining the ranks of the unbelievers. For instance, he
can point to any one of the following as fairly conclusive
evidence:&mdash;The dismal failure<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6884src"
href="#xd21e6884" name="xd21e6884src">3</a> of Christianity after
nearly two thousand years&rsquo; trial; the apparent impossibility of
and complete want of evidence for the miracles on which Christianity is
founded; the destructive criticism of the Bible, which cannot be
gainsaid; the intensely grave suspicions thrown upon the originality of
Christianity by the revelations of comparative mythology; the various
dilemmas arising from the accepted doctrine of evolution; the
inadequacy and conflicting character of the so-called <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>Theistic proofs (proofs of a personal Deity);
and, finally, the fallacies in arguments hitherto so popular and
faith-producing. We cannot get away from facts. Modern knowledge forces
us to admit that the Christian Faith cannot be true.</p>
<p>Having arrived at this main conclusion, the unbeliever is at once
confronted with many burning questions. I shall endeavour to outline
the answers to those that seem the more pressing; but the subject is a
large one, and cannot be adequately treated in a few short paragraphs.
The main difficulty is, of course, the morality problem, and, if that
admits of a favourable solution, we shall be in a better position to
consider the next question: Should the unbeliever keep his unbelief to
himself, or should he speak out?</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 2. <i>Why Lead a Moral Life?</i></h3>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch8.2.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let me say at once that if, after the elimination of
all untruths from Christianity, we could build a belief in God and
immortality on the residue, we should then have a far more powerful
incentive to right conduct than anything that I am about to urge. I
fully admit that to tell the ordinary mortal <i>brought up in the
Christian faith</i> to do right for right&rsquo;s sake will often be
futile, inspiring though the sentiment may be for some few of us. I
admit also the fact that morality always tends to the well-being of the
individual and the race. It is the one and only sound argument for the
working of any ethical purpose in nature, and, if we can feel that in
leading the moral life we are helping to carry out some high purpose in
which we are personally concerned, such a belief will certainly be of
great ethical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>value. In the following argument, however, I
hope to show that, even without a religious incentive, we have
all-sufficient reasons for leading the moral life. At present our
morality is bound up with a belief which is false, and which people are
beginning to feel and know to be false. Therefore it is more than ever
necessary that we should learn more of those reasons for morality which
do not depend upon this or that belief.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch8.2.2">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE NECESSITY FOR MORALITY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The man who does not realise that any such cogent
reasons exist will argue: &ldquo;I quite understand that the welfare of
society depends upon the moral conduct of its members; but why should I
care for the good of society? There are many immoral things which I can
do without being found out&mdash;without any harm coming to me,
directly or indirectly. Neither do I believe in the familiar adage,
&lsquo;Follow nature, and you cannot go wrong.&rsquo; Civilisation is
continually wrestling with nature; we go against nature a thousand
times a day. Why should I not follow nature just so far as I can get
out of my nerves a maximum of pleasure at the expense of a minimum of
pain? Tell me, then, you who do not believe in hell or heaven, you who
think we can live under a system of morality which entirely dispenses
with supernatural sanctions, why should I lead a moral life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question I would reply by another: &ldquo;Have you no
self-respect, the commonest and most universal incentive to right
conduct, and one which necessarily includes respect for others? Even if
your body had health, would your mind have peace without
morality?&rdquo; The essence of happiness is a contented mind. Bodily
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>ailments and other misfortunes, not of your own
making, may often mar your efforts to obtain this desirable frame of
mind; but the nearest approach to it that is possible will be gained by
leading the moral life. Righteousness contributes usually to success
and invariably to happiness, because it is in harmony with the needs
and laws of health and social life. Note, please, that I say
&ldquo;contributes.&rdquo; We are not speaking now of circumstances
beyond man&rsquo;s control&mdash;the calamities and catastrophes, daily
and hourly occurring, in accordance with nature&rsquo;s inexorable
laws, which would not be affected either way by man&rsquo;s conduct.
Also, as there are conditions under which the body may not be affected
by immorality discreetly pursued, it will be better to confine our
attention to that which is always affected&mdash;the mind. This will be
recognised more clearly when we grasp the fact that the true origin of
the guide to conduct lies in the instincts inherited from our animal
ancestors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6918src" href="#xd21e6918" name=
"xd21e6918src">4</a></p>
<p>Man is a social animal, and in his relations with his fellow-men his
moral instinct is largely a development of the social instinct. To
secure the happiness of the individual as well as of the community,
this instinct demands satisfaction. There is nothing which depresses
the mind of man or beast more than a thwarted instinct. Life, as
Aristotle has well said, is energy which each individual exercises on
those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>subjects in which he most delights. Man&rsquo;s
proper and natural pleasures must consist in the operations by which
his work is done and his task accomplished. But various circumstances
will often prevent a man or woman from exercising his or her special
aptitudes. Thus a natural instinct is disappointed, and complete
happiness is out of the question. In the case of the social instinct,
its satisfaction, so far as possible, is a supreme necessity, if there
is to be any approach to contentment of mind. To attain it there is
only one course open&mdash;the moral life. Should the individual choose
the immoral life, and should he even succeed in following it without
suffering social ostracism, he will certainly injure not only the
happiness of the community, but also his own chances of such real and
permanent happiness as this world might otherwise have afforded
him.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch8.2.3">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">USELESSNESS OF VAGUE THREATS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But, it may be objected, the average man will not be
deterred from wrong-doing by the fear of vague consequences; he is only
concerned to snatch the immediate pleasure (or what seems to him to be
a pleasure), to satisfy a momentary lust, to secure the gratification
of his senses on the &ldquo;bird-in-the-hand&rdquo; principle. That is
all very true, of course, and incidentally it accounts for the failure
of Christianity or any other belief that relies for its ethical effect
on a system of vague threats and promises. But once get rid of the
nebulosity, and all is changed&mdash;so long, that is, as the brain is
healthy, and the supremacy of reason acknowledged. Emotions of hate,
cupidity, sensuality, and the like, are always liable, as are all other
emotions, to cloud the reason&mdash;to derange the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>brain temporarily; how much more so when there
is no clear perception of disagreeable consequences? No man in his
senses will act with entire disregard of consequences; it is only when
they are not sufficiently clear that they are disregarded. It is absurd
to suppose that the ordinary man is such an unthinking animal that he
never studies ultimate consequences. The most selfish men and
women&mdash;and the religious world is not without its fair share of
them&mdash;think of the morrow. No one more so. It is the exceptional
individual of the happy-go-lucky sort, with no enemy but himself, on
whom it is difficult to impress the need of thinking ahead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch8.2.4">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE NEED FOR AN <i>EARLY</i> EDUCATION IN ETHICAL
PRINCIPLES.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My contention, then, is that a feeling of
<i>certainty</i> regarding ultimate consequences is, above all others,
the most powerful factor in influencing conduct. This certainty will be
attained through, and only through, the medium of education. Knowing
this, it is the duty of parents and teachers to be continually
implanting in the minds of the young the objects of right-doing and the
consequences of wrong-doing, wholly apart from questions of belief, not
only because such teaching enshrines a great truth, but because this
truth is liable to be lost sight of in the mists of theological dogmas
and metaphysical theories. Children, it is true, adopt moral principles
out of regard for social and parental authority, and not as the result
of reasoned conviction, so that at first the scientific reasons for
right conduct will doubtless be to some extent unappreciated. But,
meanwhile, a habit of mind will be forming, and, as the new teaching
will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>appeal to the common sense of the growing mind,
and not to its credulity, a reasoned conviction will shortly follow.
Conduct developed in this manner, free from theological speculations,
is based on a firm foundation, which no later experiences in life will
be able to upset. It is not nebulous. It is not susceptible of change
through an alteration in religious views. It is true. The future
generation, so brought up, will regard the consequences of immorality
with complete certitude, and will do so without having to extricate
themselves, as the present generation must, from objectionable habits
of thought and conduct engendered by erroneous teaching.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch8.2.5">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE OBJECT-LESSON FURNISHED BY THE JAPANESE.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is no abstract theory. We have a concrete and
magnificent example before us in a nation whose character is formed
entirely by non-theological instruction. I refer, of course, to the
Japanese. There are no people more refined, courteous, gentle, amiable,
and innately &aelig;sthetic than these Latins of the Orient; no people
more brave, hardy, and self-controlled; none more cleanly and healthy
in body and happy in mind. The Japanese army, by its perfection of
transport, commissariat, and equipment, its surgical and sanitary work,
its discipline and dash, its passionate patriotism and its humanity to
the conquered, surpasses the armies of the Christian nations who send
their missionaries to Japan. With regard to sexual morality, &ldquo;it
must be remembered,&rdquo; as Professor Inazo Nitobe remarks,
&ldquo;that, whatever charges may be made against the Japanese people,
the same charge can be, and is, actually made against every country,
England not excluded, by travellers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>since it is usually
the worst, the lax, side of life to which a foreigner is first
introduced.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6967src" href=
"#xd21e6967" name="xd21e6967src">5</a> Personally, I should say that
the charge could be met by pointing to the acknowledged virtues and
physical condition of the Japanese, and asking, &ldquo;Can these be the
result of vicious habits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are certain significant circumstances in connection with the
present moral condition in Japan which we must not omit to take into
consideration. &ldquo;Untruthfulness, dishonesty, and brutal
crime,&rdquo; says Lafcadio Hearn, speaking of Old Japan, &ldquo;were
rarer then than now, as official statistics show; the percentage of
crime having been for some years steadily on the increase&mdash;which
proves, among other things, that the struggle for existence has been
intensified. The virtue of Japanese wives was generally in all ages
above suspicion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6975src" href=
"#xd21e6975" name="xd21e6975src">6</a> &ldquo;If there has been a
serious relapse among us,&rdquo; says another writer, &ldquo;it has
been the result of the shock occasioned by our contact with the new
civilisation, and fortunately not the consequence of the abandoning of
a belief in future punishment by an offended God.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6981src" href="#xd21e6981" name="xd21e6981src">7</a>
(What food for thought&mdash;falling off in morality attributed to
<i>over-population</i> and contact with a <i>Christian</i>
civilisation!) How do the Japanese hope to solve this new problem? By
Christianity? Not at all. &ldquo;Men are beginning to see,&rdquo;
continues the same writer, &ldquo;that in the domain of morality the
excellent precepts and propositions by which their fathers were guided
under the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, but which have since fallen into
disrepute, are fundamentally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href=
"#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>correct, and that, with slight
adaptations in the light of the new civilisation, the old code of
morality will serve their purpose under the altered circumstances of
the new era.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the charge of lack of commercial morality has any foundation in
fact, and, with regard to this, here is the true explanation, given,
not by a Japanese apologist, but by a Christian missionary: &ldquo;The
Japanese are often charged, and with good reason, with a lack of
commercial morality. In days when the military virtues reigned supreme,
the handling of trade was deemed an employment which no gentleman would
take up; hence the commerce of the country is largely in the hands of
men who do not represent her best traditions. Again, certain
restrictions of mercy were always granted in the undertaking of a
contract, whereas foreigners naturally regard a contract as binding
unconditionally. But, in both respects, methods of trade are improving,
and in the excellent commercial schools it is taught that
&lsquo;Honesty is the best policy.&rsquo; Among members of the humblest
ranks of life the most striking instances of honesty will be met with;
a jinrikisha man will run after you with the parcel you have forgotten,
a shopkeeper will walk to your house to bring you a few cents he
accidentally overcharged you.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7004src" href="#xd21e7004" name="xd21e7004src">8</a></p>
<p>As to their purely secular education and the severance of belief
from conduct, Baron Suyematsu remarks that, &ldquo;to the outsiders who
have not grown up in an atmosphere of this kind, it may appear
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>somewhat difficult to comprehend how boys and
girls could be thoroughly imbued with moral sentiments without
connecting them in some way with religion; but when these are taught
with thoroughness, basing their systematic exposition on the duties of
human beings towards one another and to the State, and on the noble
tradition of their [the children&rsquo;s] own community and the
characteristic virtues of their forefathers in which they ought to
rejoice, and when appeals are made to the honour and pride which one
should feel and value, and, above all, to the conscience of
individuals, one&rsquo;s thoughts appear to become imbued with the
lessons conveyed, and moral notions thus taught seem to become, <i>per
se</i>, a kind of undefined, but nevertheless potent and serviceable,
religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7025src" href="#xd21e7025"
name="xd21e7025src">9</a> Again, Baron Suyematsu tells us elsewhere
that &ldquo;the educated classes consider that he who does what is good
for good&rsquo;s sake, and not for a fear of anything exterior, is the
most courageous man, and to be courageous is the most important feature
of <i>Bushido</i>. The probability is that, were a Japanese gentleman a
devout adherent of any particular form of religion, he would rather
conceal it than make a display of it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7033src" href="#xd21e7033" name="xd21e7033src">10</a></p>
<p>The words of other than Japanese writers may not be without some
interest. A Christian friend of mine, once an English professor in a
Japanese college, wrote to me lately: &ldquo;I must admit that the
Japanese do seem to have attained <i>without</i> Christianity a higher
status than most Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href=
"#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>nations. Indeed, they appear to
attain personal and national excellence without religion at all.&rdquo;
Again, another Englishman, who has spent a lifetime and occupies a high
position in Japan, remarks (in the course of a letter replying to my
queries): &ldquo;There is not the remotest chance of Christianity
becoming the religion of the State. For the last two centuries and a
half the educated class have adopted the Agnostic ethical system of
Confucius, which, once understood and embraced, can never be dislodged
by the Christian or any other variety of theologian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Dr. Boyd Carpenter, Bishop of Ripon, closes his book, <i>The
Witness of the Influence of Christ</i>, with the familiar assertion of
the inseparability of religion and ethics. It is an assertion which,
now more than ever, the Churches are reiterating. Why? Is it not
because they find that many are beginning to doubt its truth? I fear
reiteration will not make it any truer. Only facts will appeal to the
man who looks below the surface, and these all tend the other way.</p>
<p>In the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> for October, 1905, there is an article
contributed by the editor which deserves the earnest attention of all
thoughtful men. It is entitled &ldquo;Moral Supremacy of
Christendom.&rdquo; The following quotations from it will suffice to
show the far-reaching importance of the questions it raises:
&ldquo;Christendom, as a whole, long accustomed to treat all pagan
races as morally inferior to herself, now stands confronted by a
non-Christian civilisation, of vast power and splendid promise, whose
claim to moral equality, at least, cannot be disregarded, except by
those who are morally blind.... The hold of Christianity upon the
peoples of the Western world is rooted in the conviction that <i>this
is the religion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333"
name="pb333">333</a>]</span>which produces the best men</i>. To a
greater degree than is commonly recognised, each Church or sect of
Christendom thus derives its confidence from the final court of ethical
appeal. Whatever ground be alleged for a given doctrine, whether of
Scripture, authority, or reason, the argument would instantly lose its
force if it were to appear that the ethical result of denying the
doctrine was superior to that which followed its acceptance.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">CRIMINALITY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To return to the arguments of rational morality. A man
may say: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a bit about this social instinct you
tell me of; I don&rsquo;t know that I possess it. It is no use your
prating to me about my happiness of mind, and the necessity of my being
in harmony with my surroundings. I prefer to gratify the
instinct&mdash;the passion&mdash;that I do feel, regardless of the
consequences to others. Of course, I shouldn&rsquo;t like everybody
else to do the same. That is the beauty of my scheme, and I am not
going to miss my opportunity in the short space of existence you tell
me is all that lies before me. If it pleases me to make a beast of
myself, I shall do so.&rdquo; All I can say is that a man who really
means that this is what he would do, if not deterred by belief, is an
unfortunate, with criminal tendencies&mdash;is, in fact, of unsound
mind. His reasoning, too, is unsound. He must expect others to follow
his example, as his argument is that the whole world would become
immoral and lawless without belief. He would suffer, therefore, with
the rest, and then would be the first, if sane, to co-operate with his
fellow-sufferers in putting down lawlessness. The most savage tribe
looks after its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334"
name="pb334">334</a>]</span>own interests according to its lights. A
man who disregards the interest of all but himself becomes an Ishmael,
an outlaw, a criminal; and, in the approaching Rationalistic age, he
will be specially &ldquo;taken care of,&rdquo; and treated as any other
insane person.</p>
<p>What are the causes of criminality? The Devil&mdash;man&rsquo;s
sinful nature&mdash;the Religionist will reply. What does Science
reply? Dr. McEwen, of Glasgow, relates in the <i>Lancet</i> how a
labourer, after falling on his head from a scaffolding, <i>developed
immoral tendencies</i>. A tumour had formed on his brain. This was
successfully removed by trepanning, and <i>the immoral tendencies

brains of fifty criminals, and found imperfections in all. &ldquo;Vice
and crime,&rdquo; says Dr. Lydston, &ldquo;will one day be shown more
definitely than ever to be a matter to be dealt with by medical science
rather than by law.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7078src" href=

inherited or caused by environment) affecting the moral faculties, are
universally recognised as the real source of criminal tendencies; when
disease of the brain is no longer regarded as a disease of the
soul&mdash;then, and not till then, will criminality materially
diminish. Science will triumphantly succeed where Religion has dismally
failed.</p>
<p>The sooner, therefore, criminality is looked upon as a disease of
the brain, and dealt with accordingly, the better it will be for the
human race. A day will surely come when, as Mr. Wells
predicts,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7086src" href="#xd21e7086" name=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=

the suspension of law, to work out His purposes. Why, then, whether we
are Theists or Agnostics, should we not study and apply those laws for
our moral improvement? Even now we are doing so. Rationalism has taught
us that prevention is better than cure, and its great ally, Science, is
helping both in the prevention and the cure. But the process will be
considerably accelerated when our energies and our fortunes are spent
altogether in this direction, instead of being frittered away in futile
attempts to obtain the same results by &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;
methods.</p>

<p class="first">Again the supernaturalist may say: &ldquo;I grant you,
for the sake of argument, that, setting aside the ills of

obeying the social instinct; but human nature is weak, and requires

again repeat that I do not for one moment contend that, if Christianity
were true as <i>now</i> interpreted by <i>liberal</i> theology, or,
again, if Theism, with its assurance of a <i>benevolent</i> God, were
true, that, as Neo-Christians or Theists, we should not find belief
helpful in our efforts to lead a moral and therefore innocently happy
life; but an agnosticism regarding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336"

appears to be the only possible attitude for an enlightened world, and
it is this situation that we have now to face. Is there anything, then,
that can in any way take the place of the ethical assistance<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7114src" href="#xd21e7114" name=
"xd21e7114src">13</a> afforded by belief in God and an after-life?</p>
<p>The answer of Rationalism has already been indicated&mdash;it is to
the force of environment (in its broadest sense) that we must look in
our struggle with hereditary weaknesses. We cannot get rid of our
inherited qualities; but we can modify them by changing our
environment. If our early education, our early environment, has been
neglected, we still have it in our power to remedy, or partly remedy,
this unfortunate circumstance by our choice of present environment. The
hard case is that of a man so situated that to change his evil
environment seems well-nigh impossible. Therefore it is that the
reduction of pernicious environments is of paramount importance to the
race, and this truth the rationalistic spirit of the age is now forcing
to the front. Also, if the individual takes no interest in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>posterity, and refuses to study the question of
heredity, the day will come when the law of the land will see to it
that the sins or diseases of the fathers shall <i>not</i> be visited
upon the children &ldquo;unto the third and fourth generation.&rdquo;
It is the quality, not the quantity, of our children that we have to
keep to the forefront.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7127src" href=
"#xd21e7127" name="xd21e7127src">14</a> The methods will be simple, if
somewhat drastic; but the need to apply them will continue to lessen in
proportion as the laws of heredity and environment are better kept in
view. &ldquo;Over the past, represented by our own heredity, we have no
control. We cannot change the facts which have made the degenerate, the
neurotic, the hysterical, and the criminal; but these are only names
for human beings who, by a certain train of causation, have had certain
impulses developed and others left fallow or suppressed. A different
train of causation will awaken the capabilities to hold these impulses
in due check. This future, now represented by the environment, is
greatly within our power. Heredity being but the transmitted effects of
past environments, we have to make a suitable environment for growing
organisms if we wish to mould them to our ideals; and this is the
meaning of education.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7133src" href=

<h4 class="main">THE IMPORTANCE OF A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF
MORALITY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Finally, it is very necessary that the origin of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>morality (as indicated by Spencer in his <i>Data
of Ethics</i>, by Darwin in his <i>Descent of Man</i>, by Prince
Kropotkin in his <i>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution</i>, and by Dr.
C. W. Saleeby in his <i>Evolution: The Master-Key</i>) should be better
understood. Hitherto the question of morality has been dealt with on
wrong lines,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7159src" href="#xd21e7159"
name="xd21e7159src">16</a> and this applies to the teaching not only of
Christian but also of non-Christian religionists. It applies to the
works of those speculative philosophers who have denied the empirical
origin of man&rsquo;s moral feeling, and who have had recourse to
subtle and unconvincing theories in order to assign a supernatural
origin to the moral senses. These thinkers, in attempting to explain
the &ldquo;distinction of man,&rdquo; the &ldquo;why of
existence,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;aim of nature,&rdquo; set themselves
the hopeless task of explaining a process which entails untold
suffering upon sentient beings, and in which the modern Rationalist is
unable to discover any ethical principle whatsoever.</p>
<p>Too much prominence cannot be given to the later conclusions of
modern thought so eloquently set forth by Prince Kropotkin. Much as I
appreciate all Mr. S. Laing&rsquo;s writings, and especially, perhaps,
the chapter on &ldquo;Practical Life&rdquo; with which he closes his
admirable work, <i>Modern Science and Modern Thought</i>, I cannot
agree with him when he says (p. 113 of the R. P. A. Cheap Reprint):
&ldquo;For practical purposes it is comparatively unimportant how this
[the moral] standard got there.&rdquo; It is, in my humble opinion,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>very important, for the reasons that are clearly
demonstrated by Prince Kropotkin and other modern ethicists. So soon as
the Darwinian theory of the origin of morals is fully accepted, great
strides in the development of an improved morality will surely follow.
In fine, &ldquo;science, far from destroying the foundations of ethics,
as it is so often accused of doing, gives to evolutionist ethics a
philosophical certitude where the transcendental thinker had only a
vague intuition to rely upon.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>&ldquo;The foundation of morality is to have done, once and for all,
with lying; to give up pretending to believe that for which there is no
evidence, and repeating unintelligible propositions about things beyond
the possibilities of knowledge. She [Science] knows that the safety of
morality lies neither in the adoption of this or that philosophical
speculation, nor this or that theological creed, but in a real and
living belief in that fixed order of nature which sends social
disorganisation upon the track of immorality, as surely as it sends
physical disease after physical trespasses. And of that firm and lively

their dogmas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=

that, in the matter of intellectual veracity, science is already a long
way ahead of the Churches; and that, in this particular, it is exerting
an educational influence on mankind of which the Churches have shown
themselves utterly incapable.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>&ldquo;A moral life is that form of existence which is based upon
obedience to natural and social law.... By long transmission and
inheritance of mental and physical qualities a certain moral sense, so
to say, has been developed, now called &lsquo;conscience,&rsquo; which
suggests acts often amounting to self-sacrifice, and condemns and
represses others, pleasant and even profitable to the individual,
because detrimental to the race. Altruism and Utilitarianism have come
to be so insensibly blended that it is difficult to detect where the
one ends and the other begins.... We have attained a natural and
instinctive preference for what is good and noble in conduct,
irrespective of self-interest, just as we have risen to an instinctive
appreciation of fine music and delicate perfume.... The moral life is
derived from the universal experience of mankind, approved by the
wisdom of the wise, and justified by the fate of the
foolish.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7213src" href="#xd21e7213"

<p>&ldquo;The Supernaturalists charge the system of the Rationalists
with a lack of any effective motive that can constrain ordinary and
average men to live a moral life. &lsquo;It is all very well,&rsquo;
they say, &lsquo;for your Spinozas, your Stuart Mills, and such like,
to affect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=

they are exceptional men, and have powers of discernment and will, by
which they appropriate to themselves the moral doctrine and practice of
Christianity, while they refuse to acknowledge their debt.&rsquo;... I
daresay I might, with some success, retort the argument of
Supernaturalism. &lsquo;It is all very well,&rsquo; I might say,
&lsquo;for your apostles and saints, for your Augustines and Luthers
and Bunyans, to depend on supernatural sanctions, because they are
exceptional men, and have powers of imagination which turn shadows into
substance.&rsquo;... There is such a thing as self-respect; no man
likes to feel ashamed of himself. There are very few who are not
strongly moved by a desire to see wife and children or parents happy.
Such influences as these have far more to do with moulding human life
and resisting selfish passion than any fear of hell or desire of
heaven, or any philosophical principles. And such influences as these
will survive even when open denial of supernatural sanction becomes as
general as tacit disbelief is now.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>&ldquo;For the mass of mankind two motives serve to direct the main

first step in morality.... Sympathy did not wait to be called into life
by religion. It was born among the brutes.... In the case of man the
sympathy which issues first through the natural emotions of family and
sex is spread over an ever-widening area by the power of imagination. A
greater faculty of entering into the feelings of others goes along with
a deeper sensitiveness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href=

experience becomes ours. Our self is blended with theirs. We pity their

of the Middle Ages, and, if to-day it be otherwise, it is not to
religion we owe the change, but to the spread of education and the
progress of intelligence.... It is one of the fatalest and most
widespread of errors that morality without religion is impossible. It

<p>&ldquo;Where is the seat of authority for what is moral? This is a
very old question. Manu, the Indian law-giver, answers it in four ways:
It rests on revelation (<i>scuti</i>); it rests on tradition
(<i>smriti</i>); it rests on the behaviour of good people; and, lastly,
it rests on inward satisfaction. I believe that, in the end, the last

<p>&ldquo;Whatever power the threats of punishment and the promises of
reward in an after-life may have had in lawless and superstitious ages,
they have now but the smallest effect on conduct; their remoteness
exhausts their power, and, moreover, the belief in them is slowly

<p>&ldquo;The first step towards the elaboration of a morality which
should exercise a lasting influence is to base it upon an ascertained
truth.... The function of ethics is not so much even to insist upon the
defects of man, and to reproach him with his &lsquo;sins,&rsquo; as to
act in the positive direction by appealing to man&rsquo;s best
instincts.... It tells to man that, if he desires to live a life in
which all forces&mdash;physical, intellectual, and
emotional&mdash;should find a full exercise, he must, once and for all,
abandon the idea that such a life is attainable on the <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Memorial was lately addressed to the Local Education
Authorities of the country. Among the signatories are Lord Rosebery,
Lord Roberts, Lord Wolseley, Lord Kelvin, the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, a number of bishops, &ldquo;General&rdquo; Booth, Dr. Horton,
Dr. Campbell, the Vice-Chancellors of the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, etc. They recommend that the eight or ten years of school
life should provide the opportunity, not only for imparting knowledge,
but for inculcating those habits of self-restraint, conscientiousness,
fidelity, honour, and kindness which are needful alike for individual
self-respect and national well-being. (The <i>Code of Regulations for
Public Elementary Schools</i> [1906] has since appeared. It states
emphatically: &ldquo;Moral Instruction should form an important part of
every elementary school curriculum.&rdquo;) Sir Oliver Lodge has urged
the same thing in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>. At last, then, it has
been influentially recognised that these things are not taught in
schools, or, if so, are taught in an indifferent and unsystematic
manner. What a reflection upon Christian methods of upbringing
hitherto! Unfortunately, coupled with this desire for effective moral
training, the signatories of the Memorial express a hope that Bible
teaching will be continued. I say &ldquo;unfortunately,&rdquo; because
the ethical value of the Bible is inextricably intertwined with
supernatural beliefs that are demonstrably false. Any temporary success
of such teaching, while the children are still uninformed of the real
nature of the Bible, will be heavily discounted in after years&mdash;at
a time, too, when assistance from the ethical teaching of childhood
will be most needed. It is an unfortunate circumstance that the Church
must necessarily be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346"
name="pb346">346</a>]</span>fearful regarding the separation of belief
and morality&mdash;must set her face against non-theological moral
instruction. It is no use disguising the fact. Her fears are perfectly
well founded&mdash;such teaching <i>would</i> tend to the further
spread of unbelief. On the other hand, it is equally clear that, if any
temporary harm comes of this spread&mdash;a spread which, in any case,
cannot be stopped, though it can be delayed&mdash;it will be because
our children have been taught that religious belief is the chief, if
not the only, sanction for the moral life. The Church, in fact, will be
directly responsible for the evil. Is it not time, then, for all
thoughtful men and women to be up and doing? Is it not time the truth
should be told? In the following sections we shall see that this course
is advisable on every ground.</p>

<p class="first">Presuming that we have come to the conclusion that
Christianity is not true, are we to say so, or are we to be silent? A
believer, with ideas so advanced that his belief amounts to little more
than &ldquo;a reverent agnosticism&rdquo; concerning the fundamental
dogmas of Christianity, is still able to speak out, because while he
destroys he also constructs. He has new interpretations of Christianity
to offer us. The unbeliever can offer no such interpretations. He
simply believes Christianity to be untrue, and, should he give his
reasons, he knows he may persuade others to think so also. He must,
therefore, it seems, keep his unbelief <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>to himself, unless he
is prepared to show that the destruction of belief will be beneficial.
In considering this question of frank avowal of our unbelief, we must
not forget that, try as we may to avoid it, we are bound from time to
time to find ourselves in a position where we have to choose between
telling the truth or telling a lie; while our silence, or any
man&oelig;uvre with intent to deceive, is one continual evasion of the
truth. Is it not time, as John Morley urges,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7404src" href="#xd21e7404" name="xd21e7404src">34</a> to abandon
&ldquo;those habits of hypocritical conformity and compliance which
have filled the air of the England of to-day with gross and obscure
mists&rdquo;? In moral life truth is our guide, so that the arguments
for its repression must be irrefutable. Now, if it can be shown that
the objections to candour are more imaginary than real, not only are we
robbed of the excuse for further concealment, but we are morally bound
to fly our true colours openly. Nor is this all. Should it become plain
to us that actual good will come of truth-telling, or that the probable
good far outweighs the possible evil, it behoves us to take an active
part in, or at least to lend our support to, the spread of truth.</p>

<p class="first">One very natural objection of unbelievers, who are not
actually disbelievers, is that there may be, after all, some truth in
Christianity. We find here every shade of opinion, from that of the man
who still hopes that Christianity may be proved true in all essentials,
to that of the man who thinks that Christianity may be the symbol of a
truth. But, I ask, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348"
name="pb348">348</a>]</span>Will not Christianity, if true in any shape
or form, benefit by truth-telling? Will it not thereby assume its true
form, whatever that may eventually prove to be, and is not that a
consummation to be desired? Many believers stoutly maintain that
Christianity can be only strengthened by attack; so that, on the face
of this assertion, it would appear both justifiable and desirable to
take them at their word, and, without more ado, proceed to attack
Christianity. Certain it is that, so far, Rationalistic attacks have
done inestimable good in disclosing its errors in doctrine and
practice. As Mr. Morley caustically remarks, the efforts of the
heterodox have taught the Church to be better Christians than they were
a hundred years ago. If Christianity, purified in the cleansing fire of
modern criticism, be the true faith, and the theory of progressive
revelation can be accepted, are not this truer faith and this
peculiarly rapid progress of revelation during late years the product
of scepticism? It is the sceptics who have succeeded in forcing the
Church to reconsider her doctrines and discover new truths, and,
wonderful as it may appear, they have thus been God&rsquo;s special
instruments in this more perfect revelation of Himself. Why, then,
should you hesitate to speak out? Christianity evidently has to be
re-stated if it is to survive, and this re-statement must be complete,
for on it rests the only chance of reclaiming the unbeliever, of
arresting the further spread of infidelity, and of converting the
cultured heathen&mdash;the only chance of a universal belief in God and
Immortality. Of the result you have no cause for fear. If there be a
God, He is a God of Truth, and the Truth will prevail. <span class=

<h4 class="main">(<i>b</i>) OBSCURANTISM HAS HAD ITS DAY.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Rev. V. F. Storr, at the Liverpool Church Congress
(1904), advocated telling the truth regarding established facts, and
asked: &ldquo;In how many pulpits are the opening chapters of Genesis
frankly treated as legendary? How many teachers in schools, if called
upon to give a lesson on the Fall, would make plain to the children
that the framework of the story is imaginative? Are not the teachers
creating for them the very difficulties which, when they come to mature
years, will make shipwreck of their faith?&rdquo; These remarks were
received in dead silence by the audience, and the President was
vociferously cheered when he asked: &ldquo;Are we to tell the children
that these narratives are mere fables, with a moral teaching, or, as
Dr. Wace says, that they are true and historical, only clothed in an
Eastern symbolism? I prefer to stand with Dr. Wace.&rdquo; On the other
hand, Dean Farrar advocated a diametrically opposite course. &ldquo;We
must,&rdquo; he said,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7433src" href=
"#xd21e7433" name="xd21e7433src">35</a> &ldquo;vaccinate them [the
children] with criticism to save them from the small-pox of
scepticism.&rdquo; His successor at Canterbury has, it would appear, a
&ldquo;conscientious objection&rdquo; to this vaccination; and well he
may, for it would be far more likely to promote the disease than to
bestow immunity from it.</p>
<p>I should mention that Dr. Wace also said, at the same Church
Congress: &ldquo;If I were on Mr. Blatchford&rsquo;s side, and wanted
to attack Christianity, I should desire nothing better than that the
results of criticism concerning Genesis, as these results predominate
even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>in the most sober critical circles, should be
adopted by the Christian Church, because this would afford a means of
attacking Christianity with greater force than anything else, since it
would enable me to start with this vantage-ground, that all the Jews
and all the apostles&mdash;I dare not speak of our Lord&mdash;were
mistaken in their view of God&rsquo;s relation to His own
people.&rdquo; Obscurantism is therefore recommended because the
purpose is a pious one&mdash;namely, to confute the unbeliever and to
maintain the Faith. The anti-Christian must be deprived of his
vantage-ground by the denial of truth. It is the old, old story of
&ldquo;pious fraud,&rdquo; the mainstay of the Christian Faith. We are
to imitate (though in a lesser degree) the practices of the Latin and
Greek Churches, and continue to play upon people&rsquo;s credulity and
ignorance. We are to understand that pious frauds are still considered
legitimate weapons to employ in the defence of Christianity. Surely
such weapons should be allowed to fall into disuse for the simple
reason&mdash;if on no higher grounds&mdash;that the spread of education
is rendering them obsolete.</p>
<p>The days of obscurantism are numbered. &ldquo;Many a man in the
workshop to-day knows more about the Bible and Church history than many
a monk and bishop a few generations ago.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7445src" href="#xd21e7445" name="xd21e7445src">36</a> The Church

traditions.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7448src" href=
"#xd21e7448" name="xd21e7448src">37</a> Christian Fathers can no longer
publish their own writings in the names of disciples and apostles in
order to insure their acceptance. Evidence against the truth of
Christianity can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351"
name="pb351">351</a>]</span>no longer be destroyed or suppressed by
persecution. &ldquo;Miracles&rdquo; can no longer be worked, except
where people are still grossly credulous or ignorant. True it is that
passages of the Bible can still be read in church which every educated
man knows to be (to use a mild term) unhistorical, and which, to
console his conscience, he calls allegorical. True, in our churches,
with but few exceptions, the white lie of silence is daily told. But
even mild pious frauds of this nature will soon be a thing of the past.
The Higher Critics and the advanced school of the Church will see to
it. They are beginning to speak out&mdash;why should not you?</p>
<p>The obscurantist would do well to take to heart the answer of Bishop
Colenso to the clergyman who reproached him with depraving one of his
parishioners by criticisms of the Pentateuch. &ldquo;The blame,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;would be more fittingly attached to the teachers who
lead people to rest their faith in God and duty on a foundation of
falsehood which every new wave of thought is sweeping
away.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7456src" href="#xd21e7456"
name="xd21e7456src">38</a> Shall we, to give a glaring instance of
pious obstruction, revert to the time&mdash;not many years

from the pulpit, on the ground of impiety? I think not. Nowadays one
can hardly keep one&rsquo;s countenance in recalling the words of those
who seriously, and, as they thought, piously, said that they would
rather suffer any pain than &ldquo;enter the presence of their Maker in
a state of intoxication.&rdquo; We no longer listen to those who would
forbid us either to taste the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352"

detail,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7472src" href="#xd21e7472" name=
"xd21e7472src">39</a> and we have seen that belief and morality are not
necessarily Siamese twins, and that, when the belief is false, and
still more, of course, when it is suspected or known to be false, it is
no longer of any possible ethical value, but quite the reverse. Should
you demur, I have a question to ask, which is this: Now that, whether
we wish it or no, the truth about Christianity is fast leaking out,
and, consequently, disbelief is rapidly spreading, how is it that you,
how is it that the State, how is it that the majority outside the
Church, display so peculiarly little anxiety? I confess I am at a loss
to understand, unless it be that you and they have realised that
morality is a thing apart from belief, and therefore feel that there is
little cause for uneasiness. There is, however, an element of danger,
and, temporary though it may be, it is sure, if disregarded, to affect
the private and public morality of our own times.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch8.3.4">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">(<i>d</i>) THE REAL DANGER.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The real danger lurks, where least suspected, in the
very method which you advocate as the safest&mdash;the method of a
gradual infiltration. In many matters such a method is undoubtedly
sound. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>reformation involving a complete revolution in
opinions is best carried out gradually and tentatively, and, in this
respect, nature&rsquo;s slow processes of evolution provide a useful
lesson for the too ardent reformer. I do not suggest a cataclysm, or
suppose it possible. But I do say that your infiltration process must
be carefully watched and tended, although a policy of masterly
inactivity and <i>laissez-faire</i> may appeal to you as the easiest; I
do say with Mr. Trevelyan that &ldquo;true opinions do not spread
always, and of their own force; but sometimes, and only by dint of
courageous avowal&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7488src" href=
"#xd21e7488" name="xd21e7488src">40</a> I do say that in this
particular instance it is absolutely necessary that, side by side with
a knowledge of the untruth of the Christian religion, there should be
inculcated a knowledge of the true origin and need of morality; I do
say that the infiltration process need not and ought not to be
prolonged indefinitely, and that insincerity of any kind affects
character banefully; I do say that you should not allow your children
to be taught a false belief and a false basis of morality. This
conspiracy of silence is as mistaken and mischievous as that by which
boys and girls are allowed to find out for themselves what they should
have had properly put to them by their parents and guardians. When the
Church teaching, when the dogmas contained in the Thirty-nine Articles
of Religion, are removed, the rational teaching must take its place
<i>at once</i>.</p>

<h4 class="main">(<i>e</i>) THE CONSOLATIONS OF BELIEF, AND THE
DISTRESS WE MAY CAUSE BY OUR CANDOUR.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We cannot stop to inquire how this or that private
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>interest will suffer when the theological mist
has been dispelled. When machinery was invented&mdash;or, again, when
slavery was abolished&mdash;enormous interests were affected. Such
things will always adjust themselves. There is one difficulty, however,
which we all feel very strongly, and which cannot be passed over
lightly. We have to consider the distress of mind which the truth will
cause to those who still firmly believe, and for whom their religion is
so great a consolation that to be robbed of it would make life
objectless&mdash;a dreary desert of despair. Have we, then, any right
to disturb people&rsquo;s belief, and to lacerate their feelings? It
would almost appear, as Mr. Winwood Reade remarks, that &ldquo;we can
do nothing that is exclusively and absolutely good. <i lang="fr">Le
genre humain n&rsquo;est pas plac&eacute; entre le bien et le mal, mais
entre le mal et le pire.</i>&rdquo; Just as multitudes of martyrs are
now suffering in unhappy Russia for the sake of its eventual reform,
just as throughout history mankind owe their elevation to misfortune
and their happiness to misery, so here, also, it seems as if the
elevation and happiness in store for mankind after their liberation
from superstition can only be achieved through suffering. The
revolution will be bloodless, but it cannot be altogether tearless. Let
us see whether the mental anguish will be as great as we imagine, and
also whether it is not in the power of each one of us to adopt a line
of conduct which will tend towards a vast reduction in the number of
those who must pass through the vale of tears.</p>
<p>Are you and I any unhappier than the believer? Many of us have gone
through an ordeal more or less severe before finally relinquishing our
cherished beliefs. I will speak of that presently. But are we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span><i>now</i> any less happy than our fellows who
are believers? Except for the unhappiness which our outspoken
confession of belief may have brought upon us, surrounded as we are by
believers and professing believers, I think we can, with confidence,
say we are not; while this possible cause of unhappiness is precisely
the one which will disappear as soon as the vast multitude of
unbelievers agree to tell the truth. No longer then shall we seem, as
now, to be in a minority. Very good. We are, or should be, quite as
happy as believers; may we not suppose that, after the effect of a rude
awakening from a beautiful dream has passed off, the convert to
unbelief will settle down into the same condition of mind as ourselves?
We are free from anxiety regarding the terrible fate that some of our
Christian brethren still see fit to hold over us; but in place of their
anxiety concerning an eternal after-life, which may be blissful or may
be gruesome, the worst we expect is an eternal peace&mdash;an
undisturbed sleep, such as we hope for every night when we retire to
rest.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Can we state it as our honest opinion that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>consolations of belief enter into the every-day
life of the average man, influencing thereby his happiness? We cannot.
Only on rare occasions, in times of bereavement, or in time of his own
approaching death, will he turn to his belief for consolation. Does he
obtain then the consolation he looks for? Again the answer must be in
the negative. Here and there we come across examples of a happy
resignation such as we should expect to find; but usually it is far
otherwise. No one nurses his grief longer than the average Christian;
no one is more unwilling to die&mdash;he is really more anxious to live
than Hindoo, Parsee, Mohammedan, or Buddhist believer, or Japanese
Agnostic. Whether it be that Agnosticism engenders a spirit of
resignation, it is difficult to say; but the fact remains that no one
accepts the ills of life more cheerfully, no one meets his death more
bravely, than the average Agnostic. How often one hears of the deaths
of unbelievers quite as beautiful in their serene calm as those of
devout believers. To give examples recently before the public, we have
the heart-stirring accounts of the last moments of two well-known
Agnostics, the late Sir Leslie Stephen, the author of <i>An
Agnostic&rsquo;s Apology</i>, and the late George Jacob Holyoake, the
founder of Secularism. These may be exceptional cases; but such are
exceptional, also, among believers. According as a man is possessed of
self-control, or is naturally fearless or resigned, so will his conduct
or feelings be affected. We are speaking, mind you, of averages; and I
maintain that bereavements and death are met by the average Agnostic
with as much resignation as by the average Christian who has religious
consolation to fall back upon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357"
href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fear of death supplies the chief motive for religion. Even the
emotion called forth by the death of a friend is not solely the feeling
of the loss. It is partly because death has been brought very near to
us. Now, as the consolation afforded by religion in our last hours is
continually held up to us by the priest as a reward for belief, one
would expect to find that occasions where this consolation was
unnecessary would be few and far between. It is, however, quite the
reverse. Eliminating the cases of sudden death, how seldom are these
consolations of utility? Inquire, if you doubt, from any medical man
what are his experiences among the dying; how many are not even aware
that they are dying; how many are too much taken up with their physical
sufferings, and too anxious to be relieved from them, to think of
anything else; how many die in a space of time so brief, reckoning from
the moment when they are first made aware of their dying condition,
that the case is practically one of sudden death; how many are
unconscious from the time when their life is first in danger; how many
have the knowledge of their approaching death carefully concealed from
them by kind-hearted doctors and relations, albeit both the patient and
his attendants say they believe in a supremely happy existence after
death? Far more often than not the religious consolation so frequently
and solemnly held up to us by the priest as an inducement to believe is
never enjoyed. Does it not furnish a damaging commentary on one of the
strongest arguments for belief&mdash;the argument from religious
consolation?</p>
<p>Taking these facts into consideration, we find ourselves able to
approach the question of disturbing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>belief with a
somewhat lighter heart. Still, we have to remember that these hopes and
fears, sedulously implanted by the Church, have taken deep root. Could
we be sure of impressing believers with our own convictions concerning
the consolations of religion, all would be well; but we cannot be sure.
Here lies the crux. The idea that they are deriving, and will derive,
consolation when the dread moment is at hand has become far too fixed
for painless extraction. You may only succeed in partially divesting
them of their belief, making them thoroughly miserable to no purpose;
or, if you do succeed, it may only be after you have put them to
considerable mental distress. What is to be done, then? It is a hard
question. Feeling this, we give the matter up in despair, and remain
silent. And so the truth which we might have spread, each one of us in
his own circle, remains unspoken.</p>
<p>Worse still, the untruth is perpetuated by permitting our children
to be brought up in the false beliefs of our believing friends. This,
at least, should make us pause and reflect. Are we justified in keeping
silence? Are we justified in making no effort to save the future
generation from mental distress, or from what is far worse, a
demoralising indifference? The dilemma is great, but that is no reason
for shirking it. It must be faced, and the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>
carefully weighed. Is there, haply, no middle course that we may steer?
We should not unnecessarily cause distress to the aged who have, all
their days, cherished this belief, who have arrived at a time of life
when ideas are not easily changed, and who feel that that life is now
drawing to a close, and that they now more than ever require the
consolation they have built their hopes upon. We should spare their
feelings all we can; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359"
name="pb359">359</a>]</span>but we must, so it seems to me, put both
them and ourselves to such distress as may arise from telling them
plainly, when absolutely necessary, that we do not believe in the truth
of Christianity, and do not think it right to bring up our children to
what we consider is a false belief. We have seen that religious
tolerance is the growing spirit of the age, that some of our greatest
divines extol<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7561src" href="#xd21e7561"

shall not.</p>

<h4 class="main">(<i>f</i>) CAN WE ALTER PEOPLE&rsquo;S BELIEFS?</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another objection to &ldquo;speaking out&rdquo; is
that we can never alter people&rsquo;s beliefs. Many well-known
Agnostics still hold this opinion. In his essay, &ldquo;The Religion of
All Sensible Men,&rdquo; Sir Leslie Stephen expresses this opinion in
the following words: &ldquo;I do not wish to underrate modern progress;
but surely there is something grotesque in the hypothesis that the
average shopkeeper or artisan of the present day is too clever to
believe in the creeds of his forefathers. I fancy that no one has yet
ascertained that the brain of to-day is more capacious than the brains
of the contemporaries of C&aelig;sar or St. Paul.... Can you pierce his
[the intelligent citizen&rsquo;s] armour of stolid indifference by
arguments about the principle of evolution and the survival of the
fittest?... The improbability that ancient creeds should simply survive
must, therefore, depend upon other conditions than the increase of the
average intelligence.... I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href=
"#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>would not conceal my own views,
but neither would I feel anxious to thrust them upon others; and for
the very simple reason that conversion appears to me to be an
absurdity. You cannot change a man&rsquo;s thoughts about things as you
can change the books in his library.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7581src" href="#xd21e7581" name="xd21e7581src">44</a> With all
due respect to the late Sir Leslie Stephen, I contend that there is one
gigantic fallacy underlying this argument. He forgets, or appears to
forget, that beliefs are built upon premises, the errors in which one
may be able to demonstrate absolutely without having to enter into
learned dissertations on the principle of evolution. He declares that
he does not wish to underrate, but he certainly does underrate, modern
progress. Surely the average shopkeeper or artisan of the present day
is capable of understanding that practically nothing is left of the
foundations upon which his forefathers built their beliefs; that they
have crumbled away under the influence of a knowledge that was not in
the possession of the contemporaries of C&aelig;sar or St. Paul?
&ldquo;The laws of thought,&rdquo; as Herbert Spencer says, &ldquo;are
everywhere the same, and the ideas of a rational being are, under the
conditions in which they occur, rational.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7586src" href="#xd21e7586" name="xd21e7586src">45</a> It is
ignorance, coupled with superstition, that is at the root of all the
different beliefs of mankind. Superstition may remain, though even this
may be questioned, considering that people brought up from their
childhood as Agnostics are wholly devoid of any superstitious or
so-called religious instinct. Ignorance can in any case be dispelled,
and if this does not actually destroy supernatural <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>beliefs, it will at least modify them. Even the
working man will not remain satisfied with a theology which maintains
the necessity for a foundation of facts, and yet is unable to prove
them. Therefore, confident of the utility, let us unravel all that is
clearly false in belief, and disseminate the result of our
investigations among our fellows. In this way, men who are in all
essentials seeking the same goal may be led to pursue, if not the same
path, yet at least convergent paths. The common sophisms that it is
useless to inquire too deeply into beliefs, since you will never arrive
at the absolute truth, and that you will never get two men to think
alike, account for much of the prevalent indifference. Absolute truth
may always remain beyond the ken of man; but that is no reason why he
should not go on trying to get as near it as possible, and the first
step is the elimination of untruth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is strange to find non-Christians arguing that the
persistence of the Christian belief is a sign of its utility; it is no
more so than it is of its truth. Christianity did not make good men
what they are, but good men have made Christianity what it is. Besides,
a false belief cannot possibly serve a good purpose after its real
character has become known. Mr. Fielding urges<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7605src" href="#xd21e7605" name="xd21e7605src">46</a> that
whatever exists, whatever persists, does so because it fills a want,
because it is of use. He points his argument by alluding to the fact
that when anything is useless it atrophies, and he instances how the
snake and the whale have lost their legs, human kind their hairy skin
and keener sense <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362"

making an assertion which begs the question. He assumes that
supernatural belief is not an atrophied organ; the Rationalist contends
that it is, and that it has been proved to be so. Belief, indeed, is
strikingly analogous to an organ which, owing to its having no further
useful purpose, has atrophied and become rudimentary. It may have
served some purpose in bygone ages; but now, in its present state, it
is a source of weakness, like the splint bone of a horse&mdash;or
rather of danger, like the vermiform appendage of man. The analogy,
fortunately, does not hold good in every respect, for a false belief is
an appendage of human nature which can be safely, though perhaps not
always painlessly, removed. Indeed, it is an open question whether all
religion (in its theological sense) is not &ldquo;an unessential

consequently, it may at any time throw off without experiencing any

silence, I may be permitted to enter my protest in the weighty words of
a well-known writer. &ldquo;It is alleged,&rdquo; says the author of
<i>Supernatural Religion</i>, &ldquo;that, before existing belief is
disturbed, the iconoclast is bound to provide a substitute for the
shattered idol. To this we may reply that speech or silence does not
alter the reality of things. The recognition of truth cannot be made
dependent on consequences, or be trammelled by considerations of
spurious expediency. Its declaration in a serious and suitable manner
to those who are capable of judging can never be premature. Its
suppression cannot be effectual, and is only a humiliating compromise
with conscious imposture. In so far as morality is concerned, belief in
a system of future rewards and punishments, although of an intensely
degraded character, may, to a certain extent, have promoted observance
of the letter of the law in darker ages, and even in our own times; but
it may, we think, be shown that education and civilisation have done
infinitely more to enforce its spirit. How far Christianity has
promoted education and civilisation we shall not here venture
adequately to discuss. We may emphatically assert, however, that
whatever beneficial effect Christianity has produced has been due, not
to its supernatural dogmas, but to its simple morality. Dogmatic
theology, on the contrary, has retarded education and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>impeded science.... Even now the friction of
theological resistance is a constant waste of intellectual power....
The choice of a noble life is no longer a theological question, and
ecclesiastical patents of truth and uprightness have finally expired.
Morality, which has ever changed its complexion and modified its
injunctions according to social requirements, will necessarily be
enforced as part of human evolution, and is not dependent on religious
terrorism or superstitious persuasion. If we are disposed to say:
<i lang="la">Cui bono?</i> and only practise morality, or be ruled by
right principles, to gain a heaven or escape a hell, there is nothing
lost, for such a grudging and calculated morality is merely a spurious
imitation which can as well be produced by social
compulsion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7642src" href=
"#xd21e7642" name="xd21e7642src">49</a> &ldquo;If,&rdquo; as George
Eliot once pithily remarked, &ldquo;you feel no motive to common
morality but a criminal bar in heaven, you are decidedly a man for the
police on earth to keep their eye upon.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="main">(<i>i</i>) WHY BE SO IMPATIENT OF ERROR?</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is one more argument against militant
Rationalism which demands our attention. &ldquo;Why should we be so
impatient of error?&rdquo; asks Sir Leslie Stephen. &ldquo;The enormous
majority of the race has, on any hypothesis, been plunged in
superstitions of various kinds, and, on the whole, it has found that it
could thrive and be decently happy and contented in its ignorance.
Science declines to accept catastrophes; and no catastrophe would be
more startling than a sudden dispersal of the mists that have obscured
the human intelligence for so many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365"
href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>ages. If they grow a little
thinner in our time, we may well be content; but is it not childish to
be impatient about the rate of development of these vast secular
[age-long] processes? Why be in such a hurry to &lsquo;change the
errors of the Church of Rome for those of the Church of the
Future&rsquo;?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7659src" href=
"#xd21e7659" name="xd21e7659src">50</a> I hope I have already answered
this question to the satisfaction of some at least of my readers. I
have shown that there is a very real danger in further
concealment&mdash;in keeping up the farce. But let this pass. The
reason why we should be impatient of error&mdash;why the truth should
be told&mdash;is that the elimination of error will usher in an era of
greater happiness.</p>
<p>In order that we may the more clearly perceive this, I shall now
conclude this book with a rapid survey of the arguments for
Rationalism.</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 4. <i>The Outlook.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Rationalism reigns supreme,&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Morality will be founded on a firm basis. Its origin and
necessity being better understood, it will also be better practised,
whether in commerce, in politics, or in our social
relations&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, both in our public and in our private
conduct. Also the present atmosphere of religious insincerity will be
cleared. Relieved of this <span class="corr" id="xd21e7678" title=
"Source: tempation">temptation</span> to deceive our neighbour and even
ourselves, our moral fibre will be strengthened, and we shall be far
less likely to be hypocrites in other matters.</p>
<p>2. Social evils will stand a better chance of being redressed.</p>
<p>3. All religious intolerance will disappear once and for all.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span></p>
<p>4. An era of peace and happiness may at last be realised, because
the methods of its attainment will be scientific and rational. We shall
have recognised the fact that a gospel which proclaims a sword and
eternal damnation cannot at the same time be a gospel of good tidings,
cannot bring &ldquo;Peace on earth, goodwill towards men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be said that such optimism is absurd, but is it really
so?</p>
<p><i>Morality.</i>&mdash;Have we not seen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7694src" href="#xd21e7694" name="xd21e7694src">51</a> that
morality can be taught apart from belief, and, indeed, that it is
better so taught? May we not reasonably expect, therefore, that
morality will advance side by side with Rationalism? In the famous
words of Kant, &ldquo;The death of dogma is the birth of morals.&rdquo;
Our moral progress has not been checked by the machinations of devils,
but rather by our belief in such personages. Also by our
ignorance&mdash;ignorance of the origin and purpose of morality,
ignorance of the true causes of immorality, ignorance of the laws of
heredity and environment. Science is the good fairy who will assist
moral weaklings, and reduce their numbers in succeeding generations.
Supernatural religion was perhaps a phase through which humanity had to
grope towards the light of reason and knowledge. &ldquo;But we are now
facing the dawn of that better and happier day when piety shall be
confined within the sphere of the natural, when morals shall be looked
upon and cultivated as essential conditions of a truly blessed social
life, and when all mankind shall aim, not at imaginary happiness in a
purely imaginary realm, but at real prosperity in a profoundly real
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>world. This would be the exaltation, not
destruction, of morality; the glorification, not annihilation, of the
sense of responsibility; the enthronement, not repudiation, of the joy
of altruistic service.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7699src" href=
"#xd21e7699" name="xd21e7699src">52</a></p>
<p><i>Social Problems.</i>&mdash;Broad-minded divines are now exalting
the service of man as it has never before been exalted. &ldquo;Serve
men,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;and you will find God. Help men, and
Christ is here.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7709src" href=
"#xd21e7709" name="xd21e7709src">53</a> &ldquo;The test of Christianity
is,&rdquo; Canon Wilson informs us, &ldquo;the resolve and the power of
Christians to solve social problems. If the Bible inspires Christians
with the zeal and the wisdom and the love needed for this task, no one
will dispute its claims to be verily &lsquo;the Word of
God.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7712src" href=
"#xd21e7712" name="xd21e7712src">54</a> This inspiration to improve the
lot of our fellow-creatures furnishes, we are told, the final test of
the Bible&rsquo;s truth. We are entitled to ask, therefore, How comes
it that the inspiration has hitherto so signally failed to manifest
itself, and that it only appears now when the aspirations of the
democracy can no longer be disregarded? To give an example from
history, did not slavery flourish side by side with the Christian
Church?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7718src" href="#xd21e7718" name=
"xd21e7718src">55</a> Was it not abolished only when the further
development of humanitarian principles caused men&rsquo;s hearts to
rebel against its cruelty and injustice?</p>
<p>The Church is at last devoting more attention to social evils and to
the removal of their causes. What has taught her this duty if it be not
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>growing spirit of nationalism?<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7725src" href="#xd21e7725" name="xd21e7725src">56</a> The
Church has been forced, as it were, to keep pace with the rise of
Rationalism. It is her only chance of prolonging her existence. Her new
attitude in this respect will undoubtedly be the means of confusing the
issue&mdash;the truth of Christianity&mdash;for some years to come.
Therefore it is that, while thankful for the improvement, it is our
bounden duty to expose the real truth of the matter&mdash;to see that
Rationalism is not robbed of its due meed of praise, that the merit of
the improvement is ascribed to its proper source.</p>
<p>Also we are to see that the process of improvement is not delayed.
Undoubtedly the progress of Rationalism will ultimately involve
important changes in political institutions and philosophic theories;
but it is the cure of social evils which cannot be wrought too soon. In
proportion as we accept the natural and reject the supernatural
diagnosis of social diseases so shall we alleviate and possibly cure
them.</p>
<p><i>Religious Tolerance.</i>&mdash;Have we not seen that religious
intolerance has been the evil genius which throughout the history of
Christianity has been an enemy of progress and a lively cause of strife
and misery? &ldquo;The Christian Church has been more cruel and shed
more human blood than any other Church or institution in the world. Let
the Jew alone bear witness among the crowd of victims.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7747src" href="#xd21e7747" name=
"xd21e7747src">57</a> Also, Christians, in the course of their
intestine dissensions, have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href=
"#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>inflicted far greater severities
on each other than they have ever experienced from the zeal of
infidels.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7752src" href="#xd21e7752" name=
"xd21e7752src">58</a></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded</p>
<p class="line">That all the Apostles would have done as they did.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To-day, despite the rise and influence of Rationalism
in Europe, &ldquo;racial and religious prejudice are certainly present
among us, and they form a latent source of cruelty and injustice which
can at any time, if we are weak enough or wicked enough to give it free
play, stain the land with the most amazing oppressions.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7765src" href="#xd21e7765" name=
"xd21e7765src">59</a> Religious animus, even in a country priding
itself on its tolerant spirit, has by no means burnt itself out. Do we
not see it flaring up again in the &ldquo;War of the Kirks,&rdquo; the
Education controversy, and the arguments for the retention of the
Athanasian Creed?</p>
<p>It is necessary, as Buckle observes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7770src" href="#xd21e7770" name="xd21e7770src">60</a> that men
should learn to doubt, before they begin to tolerate; and that they
should recognise the fallibility of their own opinions, before they
respect the opinions of their opponents. We may never entirely agree on
questions that are for the present at least shrouded in mystery; but,
though the old adage, &ldquo;<i lang="la">Quot homines, tot
sententi&aelig;</i>,&rdquo; may remain true for all time, wide
differences of opinion will disappear, and with them the <i lang=
"la">odium theologicum</i>. There can only be intolerance where belief
is dogmatic, and <i>that</i> the religion of the future will never be.
The uncertainty, the reasons why others may not be able to accept this
or that philosophic speculation, will be recognised. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span></p>
<p>If any discoveries await us, we are sure, at all events, that they
will not confirm a dogma that would consign the greater portion of the
human race to unspeakable and eternal torment; they will not confirm
Christ&rsquo;s description of the Last Judgment, when the Son of Man is
to say: &ldquo;Depart from me, ye cursed, into <i>everlasting</i> fire,
prepared for the Devil and his angels.&rdquo; It is the fashion
nowadays for Latitudinarians to explain away everything that appears
too incongruous or vindictive, and the word &ldquo;everlasting&rdquo;
is said to be a mistranslation; but the meaning of one at least of the
sayings attributed to Jesus is only too clear: &ldquo;Many are called,
but few are chosen&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2022:14">Matt. xxii.
14</a>.) What, then, is to become of the many? If we are to believe the
&ldquo;Word of God,&rdquo; their awful fate, temporary or otherwise, is
certain&mdash;&ldquo;Whosoever was not found written in the book of
life was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2020:15">Rev. xx.
15</a>); or again, &ldquo;And shall cast them into a furnace of fire:
there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2013:42">Matt. xiii.
42</a>). It is cruel doctrines of this kind that have arrested the
growth of love and pity, and Rationalism is therefore the sworn enemy
of such doctrines, as well as of the religious intolerance which
springs from them.</p>
<p><i>Peace.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e7803src" href="#xd21e7803"
name="xd21e7803src">61</a>&mdash;In an address by the late Archbishop
of Canterbury, when Bishop of London, delivered at the Polytechnic,
Regent Street,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7806src" href="#xd21e7806"
name="xd21e7806src">62</a> we are presented with an argument of
Christian apologetics, the weight of which rests upon the presumption
that Christ did not wish the Church to begin with any bloodshed!
&ldquo;It is sometimes questioned,&rdquo; said Dr. Temple, &ldquo;by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>those who would throw discredit upon the
narrative, that our Lord tells them [the disciples] to go into Galilee,
and yet He intended to see them that evening. But the whole thing is
perfectly clear to those who consider the circumstances. Our Lord
appeared to them in the evening, and there can be no doubt that He
intended to do so even when He told these women that they were to
desire all the disciples to go down into Galilee. But it was of great
importance that there should be no gathering of the disciples in
Jerusalem, because the inevitable result would have been an alarm on
the part of the Jews, and Pontius Pilate would have been compelled, in
order to keep the city perfectly quiet, to disperse such an assembly by
force; and it is likely enough that the Church would have begun with
bloodshed. But our Lord did not choose to have any such beginning. He
told them all to go into Galilee.&rdquo; Are there any grounds for this
presumption, any grounds for presuming that God ever wishes to prevent
bloodshed? None whatever from a study of history. None whatever from a
study of the Bible. None whatever from a study of Christ&rsquo;s own
words: &ldquo;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came
not to send peace, but a sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look at the present day! &ldquo;We live in a time,&rdquo; exclaims
the Kaiser,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7813src" href="#xd21e7813" name=
"xd21e7813src">63</a> &ldquo;in which every young German capable of
bearing arms must be ready to step forward for his Fatherland.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The signs of the times make it the duty of the nation to
strengthen its defences against unrighteous attacks.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7816src" href="#xd21e7816" name=
"xd21e7816src">64</a> &ldquo;History, viewed as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>a
whole,&rdquo; says Major Stewart Murray,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7823src" href="#xd21e7823" name="xd21e7823src">65</a> warningly,
&ldquo;is nothing but a succession of struggles for existence among
rival nations, in which, in the long run, only the strong armed
survive.&rdquo; Similar notes of warning are echoing and re-echoing
through the length and breadth of Christendom. Is this no reflection
upon Christianity&rsquo;s power for good? Look at the picture!
Christian nations all armed to the teeth, with their &ldquo;powder
dry&rdquo; and their &ldquo;swords keen,&rdquo; each distrustful of the
other, each ready to spring at the other&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>What has the Rationalist to say to this state of things? What remedy
does he propose to apply? The prophets foretell that we can look
forward to the abolition of war only when the engines of
destruction&mdash;flying ships armed with weapons of death, for
example&mdash;are of so fearful a nature that it will at last be
brought home to mortals that this clumsy and barbarous machine for
settling disputes is too absurd, too suicidal for further employment.
But need we wait long weary years, burdened with the thousand and one
curses of war and militarism,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7831src" href=
"#xd21e7831" name="xd21e7831src">66</a> till this supreme horror has
been invented?</p>
<p>In the resolution adopted at the Fourteenth Peace <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>Congress<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7838src"
href="#xd21e7838" name="xd21e7838src">67</a> we find the following
stirring appeal: &ldquo;We are beginning to understand that the rights
of the citizen within the State can only be fully respected when, by
the establishment of international juridical order, absolute security
shall be obtained for all nations. The demand for this international
security is becoming daily more urgent, on the one hand because modern
progress binds together millions of the most diverse interests, on the
other hand because the stream of democracy, or what it would be more
proper to call the aspirations of the masses of the people after
happiness, is rising continually in an immense and irresistible flood.
International security can only be assured by federation; so federation
will come about, for it is indispensable as liberty to the citizen, as
air to the lungs. But it behoves us to see that it comes before we are
laid in the tomb. What we ought to labour for with an unresting ardour
is that federation should be accomplished while we are yet alive, so
that we may not be thwarted of the legitimate share of happiness that
belongs to us here below.&rdquo; Yes, this strikes the right chord; but
before the hopes of these peace enthusiasts can be fulfilled
Rationalism must have advanced considerably further than it has up to
the present. At the third National Peace Congress held at Birmingham on
June 13th and 14th, 1906, the opinion was expressed that the King and
the working classes were already on the side of peace, and it only
remained, therefore, to <i>convert the Church</i> and the middle
classes. How are we to set about their conversion? Even if we could
persuade the Church that war was not an essential to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>the
welfare of nations, we could hardly expect her to agree with us at
present either as to the cause or the cure of the evil. The prime cause
of war is Nature&rsquo;s cruel law, the &ldquo;struggle for
existence&rdquo;; and the Rationalist&rsquo;s proposals for its
alleviation run counter to the teachings of the Church. For this among
other cogent reasons, I conceive that it behoves us to see that the
truth about Christianity be known &ldquo;before we are laid in the
tomb,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;what we ought to labour for with an
unresting ardour&rdquo; is that this &ldquo;should be accomplished
while we are yet alive, so that we may not be thwarted of the
legitimate share of happiness that belongs to us here below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The close association of war and religion has never ceased to act
for the injury of mankind. The &ldquo;Lord of Hosts,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Lord mighty in battle,&rdquo; is expected to take interest in
bloodshed rather than in the pursuits of peace, and to be always ready
to join in the fray&mdash;to fight for His People; both sides, be it
remembered, claiming His assistance. True Christianity owns as its
Master a Prince of Peace; but in no particular has its failure in
practice been more marked than in its impotency to carry out this, one
of its chief missions. Why? Apart from religion being frequently the
actual occasion of the strife,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7848src"
href="#xd21e7848" name="xd21e7848src">68</a> is it not because it has
always meddled in politics, always supported rulers in their ambitions,
in their land-hunger? Is it not because religion has too often
submitted to be &ldquo;a &lsquo;kept&rsquo; priest to bless or ban as
the passion or self-interest of its employer dictated?&rdquo;<a class=

peace, when he, or rather his counsellors, are imbued with a hunger for
other people&rsquo;s property, and, hypocrites that they are, hide
their real motives under the cloak of religion, calling it, forsooth,
the spreading of a Christian civilisation. Every Rationalist, every

so irrational, so immoral I might say, as to propose the settlement of
disputes by arbitration, and at the same time to entertain nefarious
projects calculated to render this method impracticable. So long as
Christian nations remain unmindful of the Tenth Commandment, he
acknowledges with sorrow that we must continue armed and ready to do
battle; but he looks forward with confidence to the day when there will
be such an overwhelming body of men earnestly and sincerely desirous of
peace that war will be impossible, simply because the preponderating
voice of each and every nation will be against it&mdash;will
&ldquo;seek peace and ensue it.&rdquo; He anticipates a time when men
will realise that they are not only citizens of this or that country,
but fellow citizens also on the same planet.</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 5. <i>Concluding Remarks.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An eminent theologian tells us: &ldquo;Reason is the
only faculty we have wherewith to judge concerning anything, even
Revelation itself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7873src" href=
"#xd21e7873" name="xd21e7873src">72</a> How is it, then, that
Religionist and Rationalist arrive at such contrary conclusions? The
explanation is simple enough: the Religionist trusts, the Rationalist
distrusts, his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>emotions. Which is in the right? The survival of
religious belief will largely depend upon the view men may ultimately
take upon this question. Whether religion be no more than
&ldquo;morality touched by emotion,&rdquo; as Matthew Arnold defines
it,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7881src" href="#xd21e7881" name=
"xd21e7881src">73</a> or whether all religions are only different ways
of expressing a reality which transcends experience and correct
expression, we cannot, on that account, accept dogmas that are untrue;
we cannot pretend that a supernatural revelation has been vouchsafed to
us. We may surmise, as Sir Henry Thompson supposed, that the
&ldquo;eternal and infinite energy behind phenomena&rdquo; is what we
call &ldquo;God&rdquo;; but we have to admit that this God is an
unknown God, and that all attempts to unravel the mystery that
surrounds our own fate are the merest guesses in the dark. Does a
surmise&mdash;a belief if you will have it so&mdash;of this kind afford
any religious satisfaction? If this Eternal Energy possesses what we
should call a mind, can we worship a Supreme Intelligence</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Which stoops not either to bless or ban,</p>
<p class="line">Weaving the woof of an endless plan&rdquo;?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Can we worship the Unknown? Can we, like the Athenians
of old, erect altars to the Unknown God? I trow not. The age of
ignorance and superstition is slowly, but none the less surely, passing
away, never again to return.</p>
<p>Sir Oliver Lodge believes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7896src" href=
"#xd21e7896" name="xd21e7896src">74</a> in &ldquo;the ultimate
intelligibility of the universe,&rdquo; and with this opinion many of
us will agree. Perhaps our present brains may require considerable
improvement before we can grasp <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377"
href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>the deepest things by their
aid, or perhaps they will suffice as they are, and only a further
acquisition of knowledge may be required. In any case, one sees no
reason why, because we have no acceptable theory of life or of death
now, we must therefore be equally ignorant many centuries, or even a
single century, hence. On the other hand, it is, of course, quite
possible that these mysteries may remain for ever unexplained. It may
transpire that Haeckel&rsquo;s assumption of a monism in the physical
world, and his identification of vital force with ordinary physical and
chemical forces, are incorrect. It may transpire that Professor le
Conte was wrong in regarding vital force as just so much withdrawn from
the general fund of chemical and physical forces. Radio-activity and
the cyanic theory<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7904src" href="#xd21e7904"
name="xd21e7904src">75</a> may not furnish a satisfactory solution of
the problem of the first appearance of life upon this globe. But one
thing, at all events, our present knowledge seems clearly to indicate:
the solution of the problem cannot be in accord with the Christian
dogmas. Should the secrets of our existence still lie concealed in the
womb of time, their birth will be the death, not the renascence, of the
dying creeds of to-day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile our present course is clearly defined: we should search
out and expose all <i>false</i> premises of belief. Only in this way
can we hope to arrive a little nearer to the ultimate truth. Also, what
is of much greater consequence, when all that is demonstrably untrue in
the world&rsquo;s beliefs has been pointed out and acknowledged,
believers and unbelievers will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378"
href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>be in far better accord
concerning all that is vital to the well-being of the human race.
&ldquo;We cannot,&rdquo; as Mr. Trevelyan pertinently remarks,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7914src" href="#xd21e7914" name=
"xd21e7914src">76</a> &ldquo;alter the nature of the Unknown by
conceiving it to be other than that which it is; but we can get a wrong
basis for ethics, and a false sentimental outlook on everything, by
reason of false beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By all means let those who can, continue to cherish the
&ldquo;larger hope&rdquo;&mdash;why should they not, while all is
unknown?&mdash;and let the metaphysicians continue to translate their
wishes and aspirations into philosophical language; but the guiding
spirit in human affairs should be, and one day will be, a scientific
humanitarianism working on rational principles for the peace and
happiness of all mankind.</p>

not be out of place to mention here that various Ethical Societies in
England (and her Colonies), Europe, and America are doing all they can
to meet the ethical needs of Agnostics, and their efforts deserve far
greater support than they have yet received from the wealthy. For this
want of sympathy there are many obvious reasons&mdash;reasons,
fortunately, that will disappear in the near future. It will be urged
that the truly pious and honest believer finds prayer of the greatest
help towards right conduct, while the unbelieving ethicist is destitute
of this aid. I do not propose now to discuss the ethical value of
prayer, or consider the causes of its success and failure; but I would
ask the reader to refer to my remarks in Chapter VI. on the psychology
of prayer. Personally, I am of opinion that the practice of
<i>auto-suggestion</i> may prove useful to those in need of such
assistance, and that one day (let us hope at no distant date) psychical
research will lead to the discovery of a complete and scientific method
for the toughening of our moral fibres. See also further note in the

12&ndash;14.&mdash;<i>The Copernican system was gradually accepted, and
so were the discoveries which followed up to fifty years ago.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Copernicus&rsquo;s book, <i>The Revolution of the
Celestial Bodies</i>, was printed a few days before his death, in 1543.
The system was condemned by a decree of Pope Paul V., in 1616, which
was not revoked till 1818 by Pius VII. The great Kepler (d. 1630) was
an astrologer as well as astronomer, and thought the stars were guided
by angels. While his mind had a strong grasp of positive scientific
truth, it also had an irresistible tendency towards mystical
speculation. In those days Science and Religion were easily reconciled.
It was fortunate for Newton that he made his discovery of the law of
gravitation in a rather more enlightened age and country, otherwise he
would inevitably have shared the terrible fate of Giordano Bruno at the
hands of the Church&rsquo;s emissaries.</p>
<p>Even in the early eighteenth century the light of science had hardly
got beyond the first glimmering of dawn. Mathematics and astronomy were
the only sciences which had passed into the positive and final stage.
Chemistry, geology, biology, historical criticism, were not yet in a
position to speak with authority even on subjects in their own
province. Read a popular apologetic work of the eighteenth century;
read <i>Truth and Certainty of Christian Revelation</i>, edition 1724,
and you will find that a defender of the faith had in those days a
comparatively easy task. Science being still in its infancy, Dr. Samuel
Clarke gave reasons for the truth of Christian dogmas, which, though
they could not be controverted then, would now be considered the most
abject nonsense. Bead also Mr. S. Laing&rsquo;s remarks on p. 13 of
<i>A Modern Zoroastrian</i>, where he tells us that when he was
&ldquo;a student at Cambridge, little more than fifty years ago,
astronomy was the only branch of natural science which could be said to
be definitely brought within the domain of natural law, and that only
as regards the law of gravity and the motions of the heavenly bodies,
for little or nothing was known as to their constitution.&rdquo;</p>

18&ndash;19.&mdash;<i>The vast antiquity of the earth.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does not seem unreasonable to suppose that 500 to 1,000
million years may have elapsed since the birth of the moon&rdquo; (see
Professor Darwin&rsquo;s Presidential address at the meeting of the
British Association in Johannesburg on August 30th, 1905). <span class=

27&ndash;9.&mdash;<i>He is well aware of the odium he would incur
should he proclaim his heterodox views concerning the popular
religion.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Nor is it easy for even a well-known man to get his heterodox views
published where they will be widely read. Sir Hiram Maxim wrote lately
to the <i>Literary Guide</i> concerning his letter in the &ldquo;Do We
Believe?&rdquo; correspondence, saying &ldquo;it was necessary for my
letter to have a slight coating of ecclesiastical sugar, otherwise it
would not have been published.&rdquo; Does the Church realise the
extent to which men of science coat their popular writings with
&ldquo;ecclesiastical sugar&rdquo;? The retail bookselling trade in
England is still largely in the hands of persons belonging to the
various sects, and, even where this is not so, few dare to push the
works of glaringly heterodox writers. As an example of the difficulties
which beset the way of a too truth-loving author, we may notice that it
took three years before 2,000 copies of Mr. Samuel Laing&rsquo;s
<i>Modern Science and Modern Thought</i> could be sold, and its sale
brought him no pecuniary profit.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb19" class="pageref">19</a>, lines
2&ndash;3.&mdash;<i>He</i> [Sir Oliver Lodge] <i>has never yet
professed belief in a personal God.</i></p>
</div>
<p>He has now done so. In an article entitled &ldquo;First Principles
of Faith,&rdquo; appearing in the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> for July,
1906, he has drawn up a new formula of faith, which commences: &ldquo;I
believe in one Infinite and Eternal Being, a guiding and loving Father,
in whom all things consist.&rdquo; He continues: &ldquo;I believe that
the Divine Nature is specially revealed to man through Jesus Christ our
Lord, who lived and taught and suffered in Palestine 1,900 years ago,
and has since been worshipped by the Christian Church as the immortal
Son of God, the Saviour of the world.&rdquo; This reconstructed
Christian (?) creed has been deftly worded; but this, at least, is
clear&mdash;the Virgin-birth, Resurrection, and Ascension form no part
of the religious belief of Sir Oliver Lodge. The full text of the
&ldquo;Catechism&rdquo; which he has designed for the use of teachers
and others interested in the education of the young appears in the
Standard of December 14th, 1906.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb20" class="pageref">20</a>, line
31.&mdash;<i>The religious naturally wish to discredit science.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It is a common assertion of the pious that modern science has
continually to retrace its steps, and admit that it was mistaken in its
facts and theories. The following pronouncement by Professor Ray
Lankester, in his Presidential Address at the annual meeting of the
British Association (held at York in 1906), should disillusion them:
&ldquo;During the last few years an idea has spread abroad that some of
the more recent discoveries of science have revolutionised scientific
ideas&mdash;have upset former theories, or have reversed them. Nothing
is further from the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb25" class="pageref">25</a>, lines
19&ndash;20.&mdash;<i>They</i> [Agnostics] <i>&ldquo;exhibit the very
temper which Christ blesses.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<p>Canon Scott Holland&rsquo;s precise words were: &ldquo;It is no
petulant boy making his petulant repudiation, but a man with steady and
deliberate judgment, weighing, examining, testing, and still, at last
to his own sorrow, to his own confessed cost, bravely facing what he
deems to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>be the fact, and pronouncing, &lsquo;I am not of
the Body; I cannot share the life of the Christian community.&rsquo;
And yet, if we look at him, we recognise in every detail of his
character the lines that lead to Christ. He illustrates and exhibits
the very temper which Christ blesses; he is pure, unselfish, humble,
and good.... He may say what he pleases, but Christ has not forsworn
him.&rdquo; Subsequently he acknowledges in moving terms that, <i>as
the populations are emerging from out of their darkness, so they are
repudiating the name of Christ</i>. But he gives no explanation for a
circumstance so perplexing to a Christian.</p>
<p>Let me not be misunderstood to say that this extremely lenient view
towards the Agnostic is the usual one at present. On the contrary, the
Bishop of Moray voices the opinion of the majority of the orthodox when
(at the Diocesan Synod held at Inverness Cathedral in the autumn of
1904) he challenges the wisdom of this sympathetic attitude, and asks:
&ldquo;Is this a time to banish into silence, or relegate to an
inferior position, the great bulwark of the Faith&mdash;the Athanasian
Creed?&rdquo; We are to understand that the curses of the Creed are
reserved, not for the man who is born of heathen parents, but for the
man who, often with much uprooting of his dearest hopes, and at the
cost of losing many friends and even his original means of livelihood,
decides that he must forsake the Faith. It seems to me that, before
converting the heathen, it would be only fair that the terrible fate
they will incur by any subsequent recantation should be distinctly
explained to them.</p>
<p>Again, the Rev. J. Morgan Gibbon, in his pamphlet, <i>Atheism and
Faith</i>, represents the Atheist in the guise of the Tempter
&ldquo;holding out the bribe of free indulgence of all the passions to
our youth, our working classes, our governing classes, and our
capitalists.&rdquo; Clergymen who speak with such bitterness and make
such sweeping assertions really betray the weakness of their own case.
For it is a psychological fact that men are always angriest when they
know they are not quite in the right. It is also a statistical fact (so
far as statistics can be relied upon for facts) that crime among
disbelievers is proportionately small, while among the staunchest
believers, the Roman Catholics, it is proportionately large.</p>

adjective.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The Riddle of the Universe was described as a &ldquo;book of
rubbish&rdquo; by Father Gerard, a member of the &ldquo;Society of
Jesus.&rdquo; He has not the least authority for such an indictment. On
the contrary, every single biologist would tell him that he was himself
talking rubbish. The Turin Academy crowned it as the best book written
in the last four years of the nineteenth century. Clergymen seem to
prefer to get their science from apologetic works only. How many, I
wonder, have ever read the masterly exposition of the case for
Haeckel&mdash;<i>Haeckel&rsquo;s Critics Answered</i>, by Joseph
McCabe?</p>

13&ndash;14.&mdash;<i>&ldquo;In relief of doubt.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<p>A work entitled <i>In Relief of Doubt</i>, by the Rev. R. E. Welsh,
a Presbyterian minister, is an attempt by an exceedingly earnest man to
remove doubts concerning the Bible. There is an introductory note by
the Bishop of London. The book is written in what the Bishop terms a
&ldquo;racy&rdquo; style, and has the merit of much
straightforwardness; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382"
name="pb382">382</a>]</span>but few well-informed, and at the same time
open-minded, readers would agree with the conclusions of the author.
The argument that St. Paul was a contemporary of Christ is one of the
principal features; but see Chap. II., &sect; 3, and Chap. III., &sect;
2.</p>

27&ndash;8.&mdash;<i>The Roman Catholic Church in Ireland.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In <i>Priests and People in Ireland</i>, by Michael McCarthy, there
is a complete expos&eacute; of the methods and results of Christian
teaching in this portion of the British Isles, and a portrait of a
typical Roman Catholic priest which demonstrates his elevating (?)
influence. Also see <i>Twelve Years in a Monastery</i> and <i>Life in a

<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb33" class="pageref">33</a>, lines
32&ndash;3.&mdash;<i>The Roman Catholic Church is more
consistent.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Papal Church, founded, to a large extent, on superstition
and ignorance, has ever been afraid of knowledge, of study, and
education; hence she only consulted her own life&rsquo;s interests
when, in the Middle Ages, she decreed knowledge to be identical with
heresy, and heresy to be punishable by death.&rdquo; These words are
quoted from <i>The Roman Catholic Church in Italy</i>, by the Rev.
Alexander Robertson, D.D., a book accorded a flattering reception by
the King of Italy in 1903. Again, Lord Macaulay, speaking of the Roman
Catholic Church in the first chapter of his <i>History of England</i>,
says that, &ldquo;during the last three centuries, to stunt the growth
of the human mind has been her chief object. Throughout Christendom,
whatever advance has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth, and
in the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has everywhere
been made in inverse proportion to her power. The loveliest and most
fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in poverty,
in political servitude, and in intellectual torpor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb38" class="pageref">38</a>, line
7.&mdash;<i>Gifts for the needy.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The exhortation to &ldquo;give to the poor&rdquo; is a precept of
all the great religions. Indiscriminate giving was inculcated by the
disciples of Christ, who <i>were</i> the poor, and Asiatic poor at
that. The pity of it is that often more harm than good is done because
the &ldquo;Divine&rdquo; command does not specify the <i>deserving</i>
poor. Hence that wholesale pauperisation of which the evil effects are
especially apparent among the Jews and in Oriental countries.</p>

22&ndash;3.&mdash;<i>Mansel, Mozley, Farrar, Westcott</i>, on
Miracles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dean Mansel said: &ldquo;If there be one fact recorded
in Scripture which is entitled, in the fullest sense of the word, to
the name of a miracle, the Resurrection of Christ is that fact. Here,
at least, is an instance in which the entire Christian faith must stand
or fall with our belief in the supernatural.... A superhuman authority
needs to be substantiated by superhuman evidence, and what is
superhuman is miraculous&rdquo; (pp. 3 and 35 of <i>Aids to Faith</i>,
4th ed.).</p>
<p>Canon Mozley said: &ldquo;Miracles and the supernatural contents of
Christianity must stand or fall together&rdquo; (Bampton Lectures,
1865). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dean Farrar said: &ldquo;However skilfully the modern ingenuity of
semi-belief may have tampered with supernatural interpositions, it is
clear to every honest and unsophisticated mind that, if miracles be
incredible, Christianity is false&rdquo; (<i>The Witness of History to
Christ</i>, Hulsean Lectures for 1870, 2nd ed., p. 25).</p>
<p>Bishop Westcott said: &ldquo;The essence of Christianity lies in a
miracle, and, if it can be shown that a miracle is either impossible or
incredible, all further inquiry into the details of its history is
superfluous from a religious point of view&rdquo; (<i>The Gospel of the
Resurrection</i>, 3rd ed., 1874, p. 34). See also Archbishop
Trench&rsquo;s <i>Notes on Miracles</i>.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb44" class="pageref">44</a>, lines
28&ndash;9.&mdash;<i>The opinion of the majority of our living
dignitaries</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>This has been made abundantly clear by the unanimous reply of a
large number of Bishops to a correspondent of the <i>Record</i>, who
had written letters to them stating that he had heard that &ldquo;not a
single Bishop on the bench to-day believed in the miraculous in
religion&rdquo; (reported in the daily papers towards the close of
January, 1905).</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb48" class="pageref">48</a>, lines
25&ndash;6.&mdash;<i>Some even hold that it</i> [devil-possession]
<i>still exists.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Thus, in the introduction to <i>Pastor Hsi</i> (a book of which
24,000 copies were printed between 1903 and 1905), the Rev. D. E.
Hoste, General Director of the China Inland Mission, not only expresses
this belief, but seeks to explain why devil-possession should now be
chiefly confined to heathen lands. &ldquo;Careful observation and study
of the subject have,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;led many to conclude that,
although in lands where Christianity has long held sway the special
manifestations we are now considering are comparatively unknown, the
conditions among the heathen being more akin to those prevailing when
and where the Gospel was first propagated, it is not surprising that a
corresponding energy of the powers of evil should be met with in
missionary work to-day.&rdquo; He would have us believe, apparently,
that the atmosphere of holiness in Christendom is so overpowering that
the Devil and his crew are rendered less active! Taking him seriously,
can he also explain how it is that God permits devils to perform such
pranks? Not only is the house &ldquo;swept and garnished&rdquo; that
they may &ldquo;enter in, and dwell there&rdquo;; but in the case of
Saul we are told that they were purposely sent by God! (See <a class=

<p>The importance of this question is brought home to us by Mr. Benn in
his <i>History of English Rationalism in the Nineteenth Century</i>,
where he says (p. 454): &ldquo;The witness of Jesus to the Fatherhood
of God as a personal spirit amounts to no more than his witness to
personal devils as authors of disease; and the witness of the
Evangelists to their Master&rsquo;s authorship of the Sermon on the
Mount is less unanimous than their witness to the destruction by
diabolical agency of the Gadarene swine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb49" class="pageref">49</a>, lines
13&ndash;14.&mdash;<i>The feeding of the five thousand.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Bishop Ingram attaches the utmost importance to the truth of this
miracle. In a sermon published in the <i>Church Times</i> of October
7th, 1904, he is reported to have said: &ldquo;It is the worst policy
of defence to throw over the miracle of feeding the five thousand, or
our Lord&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384"
name="pb384">384</a>]</span>power over disease and death, and then
expect to keep the faith of the world in His incarnation, His
Virgin-birth, and His resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb61" class="pageref">61</a>, line
14.&mdash;<i>The simple theory of the spiritists.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Moncure Conway relates, in his <i>Autobiography</i>, how it was
a spiritualist <i>s&eacute;ance</i> which made him realise the kind of
frenzy that took possession of those early Christians who really
believed that a dead man had returned to life. See also Professor
Lombroso on &ldquo;spiritualistic&rdquo; phenomena, p. 396.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb64" class="pageref">64</a>, lines
20&ndash;1.&mdash;<i>Few of us have ever had our belief tested.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Persons who have never spent their lives, or a portion of their
lives, among the heathen, have never had their faith put to the fullest
test, for in such an environment they would find faith&rsquo;s
difficulties considerably enhanced. I remember, a few days after my
arrival in India, a certain Bishop looking me in the face and, with a
kindly hand upon my shoulder, saying: &ldquo;You will find life much
more difficult in India.&rdquo; He referred, of course, to the
religious life, and was quite right, although, probably, he was
thinking chiefly of the example that I should find set me by my fellow
Christians; while, as mine was largely a camp life, it was more the
insight into the belief of my native companions which affected me.
There, all around you, are simple folk believing in what you know to be
absurd; you are brought face to face with ignorance and superstition;
you see how faith can be misplaced, and how trusting natures can be
deceived. It sets you thinking whether, after all, you too may not be
deceived; whether the possession of an unlimited capacity for faith has
the virtue in it which the priest tells you it has, whether, in fact,
faith is a reliable guide. Should you attempt to convert an educated
native, you not only find that the task is hopeless, but that you are
asking him to accept a belief which is as unfounded and unproven as the
one he already holds. Anyone wishing to form some idea of an experience
of this sort should read <i>The Bible: Is it the Word of God?</i> by
Thomas Lumsden Strange, formerly a judge of the High Court of Madras.
The way the observations are cast in the shape of a conversation
between a student of the Bible and a cultured native of India brings
home many Bible difficulties which largely escape the notice and
consideration of the devout. I have taken my illustration from this
book.</p>

<p>The rapid advance of Bible criticism in late years is well seen by
comparing articles in Dr. W. Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of the
Bible</i> (1860), in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, signed
W. R. S. (between 1875 and 1888), and in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Biblica</i> (1899 to 1903). Even the comparatively conservative
<i>Hastings&rsquo;s Dictionary</i> (1898&ndash;1902, with extra volume
1904) contains articles which would have been condemned as heretical
half a century ago. Speaking of the <i>Enc. Bib.</i> and
<i>Hasting&rsquo;s Dictionary</i>, Mr. Benn remarks (in his <i>History
of Rationalism</i>) that, &ldquo;as regards the Old Testament, their
respective attitudes do not essentially differ, Wellhausen&rsquo;s
theory being accepted by both.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The sceptical theory is that, had it been genuine, the passage would
not have been overlooked by all the early Christian writers in the
various disputations with objectors, and especially by Tertullian,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>who quoted largely from his works, and the
ecclesiastical historian Eusebius, who was zealous in his defence of
the Faith and greedy of materials with which to support it. (An
important French student of Tacitus holds that the whole <i>Annals</i>
is medieval!) On the other hand, the style is thoroughly Tacitean,
containing a number of words and expressions elsewhere used by the
author, and more or less characteristic of him, yet without any such
elaborate over-imitation as we should expect to find even in a skilful
forgery. Nor is the subject-matter perhaps less characteristic, while
the MS. evidence is in favour of the passage being genuine. Taking it
to be so, what, after all, does it amount to? Merely this. Christ was
put to death by Pontius Pilate, and a very large number of Christians
were put to death in a horrible manner by Nero. The passage occurs in
Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, XV., 44, and runs as follows:
&ldquo;Consequently, to get rid of the accusation, Nero fastened the
guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for
their abominations, called by the populace &lsquo;Christians.&rsquo;
Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme
penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our
procurators, Pontius Pilate, and a most mischievous superstition, thus
checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Jud&aelig;a, the
first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous
and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become
popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded
guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was
convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred of
mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with
the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were
nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt to serve as a
nightly illumination when daylight had expired. Nero offered his
gardens for the spectacle.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Maya dreams that she is carried by archangels to heaven, and that
there the future Buddha enters her right side in the form of a superb
white elephant. Rhys Davids relates this legend on p. 183 of his
<i>Buddhism</i>, and in a footnote he says: &ldquo;Csoma Kor&ouml;si
refers in a distant way to a belief of the later Mongol Buddhists that
Maya was a virgin (As. Res. xx. 299); but this has not been confirmed.
St. Jerome says (<i lang="la">Adversus Jovin.</i>, bk. 1): &lsquo;It is
handed down as a tradition among the Gymnosophists of India that
Buddha, the founder of their system, was brought forth by a virgin from
her side.&rsquo;&rdquo; In Samuel Beal&rsquo;s <i>Romantic History of
Buddha</i> (from the Chinese version) we read of Buddha&rsquo;s
miraculous birth, and that there is ground to assume the prevalence of
this belief for centuries before Christ. Bunsen, again (p. x. of his
<i>Angel-Messiah</i>), speaks of the &ldquo;Virgin Maya, on whom,
according to Chinese tradition, the Holy Ghost had descended&rdquo;;
and elsewhere (<i>e.g.</i>, pp. 10 and 25) he adopts this version of
the legend. Dr. Knowling, in his apologetic work, <i>Our Lord&rsquo;s
Virgin Birth and the Criticism of Today</i>, pp. 53&ndash;4, lays
stress upon the grotesqueness of the idea that a man should enter his
mother&rsquo;s womb in the form of a white elephant. But, as Dr. Rhys
Davids explains (p. 184 of <i>Buddhism</i>), there is nothing bizarre
when the origin of the poetical figure has been ascertained. The belief
was borrowed from the older sun-worship, &ldquo;<i>the white elephant,

</div>
<p>Dr. Rhys Davids&rsquo;s remarks on the <i>early</i> growth of myths
concerning Buddha, coming as they do from a champion of the Christian
cause, are full of significance for anyone who permits himself to think
and who keeps an open mind. He says (p. 182 of <i>Buddhism</i>):
&ldquo;The belief soon sprang up that he could not have been, that he
was not, born as ordinary men are; that he had no earthly father; that
he descended of his own accord into his mother&rsquo;s womb from his
throne in heaven; and that he gave unmistakeable signs, immediately
after his birth, of his high character and of his future
greatness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have a perfect illustration of the possibility and rapidity of
the legend-making process in the nineteenth century. The Bab (or
&ldquo;gateway&rdquo;) was a Persian reformer who suffered martyrdom at
the hands of the authorities in 1850. Within forty years an evidently
mythical version of his life was current among his followers in the
form of a Gospel. Babism inculcates a high morality, and there is a
likelihood of its becoming paramount in Persia. For further information
on this new religion see <i>Life and Teachings of Abbas Effendi</i>, by

the glorifying of sensual desire which is so far removed from the

columns of brass or marble, on which a distinct narrative of each
particular cure was described. There is a remarkable fragment of one of
these tables still extant, and exhibited by Gruter in his collection
(just as it was found in the ruins of the temple of &AElig;sculapius in
the Tiber island), which gives an account of two blind men restored to

Encyclop&aelig;dia,&rsquo; Kai-yuen-shi-kian-mu-lu, that the

may therefore safely suppose that the original work was in circulation
in India for some time previous to that date.&rdquo; (Quoted from the
Introduction to Mr. S. Beal&rsquo;s <i>Romantic History of Buddha</i>.)
Thus, as the writer of the article on the Gospels in the <i>Enc.

[and resurrection] <i>of their Saviours.</i></p>
</div>
<p>At the winter solstice the sun seemed to the ancients to be
commencing its annual journey round the heavens. Accordingly, December
25th was considered to be the sun&rsquo;s birthday, which was annually
celebrated by a great festival in many parts of the heathen
world&mdash;in China, India, Persia, Egypt, and also in ancient Greece,
Rome, Germany, Scandinavia, Great Britain, Ireland, and America.
Similarly, at the vernal equinox, the sun, which has been below the
equator, suddenly appears to rise above it, and so, usually upon a date
calculated by the pagan astronomers (and corresponding roughly to our
Easter), we find that throughout a considerable portion of the ancient
world, after mourning the sun&rsquo;s death (sometimes for a period of
three days), the Resurrection was celebrated with great rejoicings.
Primitive man regarded all sensible objects as instinct with a
conscious life. He noted the changes of days and years, and the objects
which so changed were to him as living things. The rising and setting
sun, the return of summer and winter, became a drama in which the
actors were his friends or enemies. It was no allegory, but, strange as
it appears to us now, all an absolute reality. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span></p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s birth was ultimately placed at the winter solstice,
the birthday of the sun-god in the most popular cults; and, while that
is fixed as an anniversary, the date of the Crucifixion is made to vary
from year to year in order to conform to the astronomical principle on
which the Jews, following the sun-worshippers, had fixed their
Passover. This ignorance of the early Church concerning the dates of
the Jesus&rsquo; birth, death, and &ldquo;resurrection,&rdquo; is an
exceedingly suspicious circumstance. If the fundamental verities were
an objective fact to the early Christians, how <i>could</i> the dates
have been so utterly forgotten that dates belonging to idolatrous
superstitions had to be adopted? It is perplexing enough that God
should have allowed the memory of His Son&rsquo;s life on earth to be
handed down for a considerable time by tradition only; but that He
should have permitted such lapses of memory and the substitution of the
dates of pagan festivals is to me altogether inconceivable. It could
not but raise suspicion concerning His revelation in future thinking
generations. We have a certain knowledge of the dates of comparatively
unimportant events in the world&rsquo;s history, ages before the
Christian era. If these important dates could be forgotten, what else
may not have been forgotten; what else may not have been substituted in
the place of forgotten incidents? Again, did not the disciples and
their converts celebrate the anniversaries of these great events? And,
if so, on what dates? The question is of more importance than perhaps
at first sight it appears to be. The public will soon be asking the
Church for a satisfactory explanation, and she must be prepared to
furnish it. In the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, during the Christmas of
1904, the public were informed that &ldquo;the most erudite
arch&aelig;ologists and professors of Church history confess that there
is not a particle of evidence, either Biblical or traditional, for the
claim of December 25th to be the birthday of Christ, and that
everything goes to prove that our existing festival of the Nativity was
introduced to replace the heathen festival of the &lsquo;sol
invictus&rsquo; in Southern Italy, and of the Yule or Winter solstice
festival among the ancient Teutons.&rdquo; Again, in the <i>Daily
Graphic</i> during the Easter of 1905, the public will have read that
&ldquo;there is no particular sanctity in the &lsquo;Table to Find
Easter,&rsquo; based as it is upon the calculations of a pagan
astronomer who lived four hundred years before Christ.&rdquo; In France
the Christian names of the four statutory holidays have been abolished
by law. Christmas is called the Festival of the Family, and so on. The
time is coming, and is even now at hand, when the English public will
discover ugly facts about Christianity without having to read books
published by freethinking firms&mdash;books which the parson advises us
to leave severely alone.</p>

the mystic rites of the one who is being initiated, you either know or
can learn.&rdquo; Tertullian intimates that &ldquo;the devil, by the
mysteries of his idols, imitates even the main parts of the divine
mysteries. He also baptises his worshippers in water, and makes them
believe that this purifies them of their crimes. There Mithra sets his
mark on the forehead of his soldiers; he celebrates the oblation of
bread; he offers an image of the resurrection, and presents at once the
crown and sword; he limits his chief priest to a single marriage; he
even has virgins and his ascetics (<i lang=

Bapt.</i> c. 5; <i>De Corona</i>, c. 15. Quoted on p. 322 of J. M.
Robertson&rsquo;s <i>Pagan Christs</i>.) We have also the witness of
modern discoveries. For example, Professor Franz Cumont, in his work,
<i>Les Myst&egrave;res de Mithra</i>, gives a photograph of a
recently-discovered bas-relief, representing a Mithraic communion. On a

14&ndash;15.&mdash;<i>Ignorance of the gist of the Darwinian theory,
&ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; has been fruitful in
misunderstandings.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is very necessary to understand exactly what the
theory of natural selection is and is not; because champions of the
Faith, even when believing in Evolution, base some of their arguments
on the alleged collapse of the Darwinian theory. Thus, in
<i>Present-day Rationalism Critically Examined</i>, the Rev. Professor
George Henslow affirms that, while the theory of Evolution stands on an
impregnable basis, Haeckel&rsquo;s Monism and Rationalistic agnosticism
are based on Darwin&rsquo;s doctrine of natural selection, and he
enters upon an elaborate argument&mdash;covering sixty pages of his
book&mdash;to show that the origin of species by means of natural
selection is false, and that the primary cause of Evolution is the
definite action of the environment, combined with the adaptive powers
of the living organism. Such arguments, coming from a clergyman having
scientific attainments, are likely to impress the average Christian
reader and confuse the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href=
"#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>main issue. Natural selection
<i>is</i> &ldquo;the action of the environment&rdquo; (see T<i>he
Origin of Species</i>, chap. iv.), and even if it were not, and if
natural selection (or <i>elimination</i>) were not the primary cause,
the doctrine of the action of environment will suit the Monist just as
well.</p>
<p>Regarding the minor, but not unimportant, part played by sexual
selection, Darwin writes: &ldquo;For my own part, I conclude that of
all the causes which have led to the differences in external appearance
between the races of men, and to a certain extent between man and the
lower animals, sexual selection has been by far the most
efficient&rdquo; (<i>Descent of Man</i>, ed. 1871, ii., 367).</p>
<p>Scientists who are advocates of the Christian cause are not always
as candid as one could wish. While the Church cited Sir Richard Owen
&ldquo;as an authority against the Darwinian theory, especially in its
application to man&rsquo;s descent, there remained in the memory of his
brother savants his lack of candour in never withdrawing the statement
made by him, and demonstrated by Huxley as untrue, that the
<i>hippocampus minor</i> in the human brain is absent from the brain of
the ape.&rdquo; (See p. 172 of Mr. Clodd&rsquo;s <i>Pioneers of
Evolution</i>. See also remarks by Sir Charles Lyell, pp. 485 and 486
of his work, <i>Antiquity of Man</i>. On p. 290 he further tells us
that &ldquo;we may consider the attempt to distinguish the brain of man
from that of the ape on the ground of newly-discovered cerebral
characters, presenting differences in kind, as <i>virtually</i>
abandoned by its originator.&rdquo;)</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. <a href="#pb205" class="pageref">205</a>, lines
18&ndash;20.&mdash;<i>That there are not more links missing is due
principally to the discovery of fossil remains.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The greatest importance has been attached to a discovery in Java,
made in 1894 by Eugene Dubois. The remains consisted of the crown of
the skull, two teeth, and a femur belonging to a creature for which the
name <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> has been invented. This
pithecanthropus excited the liveliest interest as the long-sought
transitional form between man and the ape. Professor Haeckel writes
concerning this in his book, <i>The Evolution of Man</i>, vol. ii., p.
633: &ldquo;There were very interesting scientific discussions on it at
the last three International Congresses of Zoology (Leyden, 1895;
Cambridge, 1898; and Berlin, 1901). I took an active part in the
discussion at Cambridge, and may refer the reader to the paper I read
there.&rdquo; (It has been translated by Dr. Gadow, under the title of
<i>The Last Link</i>.) Since then we have Professor Keasbey writing in
1901 that the remains have been &ldquo;pronounced genuine,&rdquo; and
Professor Packard, in 1902, that it is now &ldquo;generally
recognised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, to give a still more recent &ldquo;find,&rdquo; Dr. Andrews,
who accompanied the Geological Survey of Egypt, has (as mentioned by
Professor Ray Lankester in his lecture at the London Institution on
November 2nd, 1906) discovered a remarkable skull (now in the Natural
History Museum) which is the connecting link between elephants, ancient
and modern, and other mammals.</p>
<p>There have also been discoveries of missing links among the living.
The duck-bill, a four-footed animal which lays eggs, is an important
link between reptiles and mammals. Cuvier, the celebrated French
naturalist, a persistent opponent of the evolutionary doctrines
advanced by Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, did not believe it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>possible that any four-footed animal could lay
eggs, and it was not till long after his time, and, indeed, only quite
lately, that the statements of the natives were verified, and the eggs
of the duck-bill actually found.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;God,&rdquo; says Canon Liddon, &ldquo;is
banished from the world by deism, which puts nature in His place&rdquo;
(<i>Some Elements of Religion</i>, pp. 56&ndash;7). The seventeenth and
eighteenth-century deists, however, did not deny the personality of
God, but the fact of revelation. &ldquo;In recent theology deism has
generally come to be regarded as, in common with theism, holding in
opposition to atheism that there is a God, and in opposition to
pantheism that God is distinct from the world, but as differing from
theism in maintaining that God is separate from the world, having
endowed it with self-sustaining and self-acting powers, and then
abandoned it to itself&rdquo; (<i>Enc. Brit.</i>, art.

<p>Archdeacon Wilson avers that &ldquo;We dare not deny the name of
Christian to such as live in Christ&rsquo;s spirit and do His will,
though they know not for certain how God manifested himself in Christ,
and will not profess a certainty they do not feel.&rdquo; Again, he
argues that &ldquo;We rest on the broad ground of the vast experience
of the world, and the testimony of our own conscience, that Christ has
lifted mankind up, and shown man what is good; and this we may describe
as bringing man to God, and revealing God to man. This redemption,
salvation, we acknowledge as a fact. He who has this faith in Christ,
and lets it work its natural result in making him more like Christ,
deserves to be called a Christian.&rdquo; This does, indeed, give
plenty of latitude&mdash;far more, in fact, than the Church as a body
seems likely to give for some time to come. It, and the Rev. R. J.
Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Theology,&rdquo; will certainly enable many
who are in reality non-Christian theists to continue calling themselves
Christians.</p>

for religious superstitions.</i></p>
</div>
<p>With regard to phenomena at present popularly known as
spiritualistic, but for which scientists have now adopted the term
&ldquo;metapsychical,&rdquo; the following declaration by Professor
Lombroso (appearing in the review <i>La Lettura</i>, November, 1906) is
of considerable interest. &ldquo;As the result,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;of our researches, I have been bound to admit the conviction
that these phenomena are of colossal importance, and that it is the
plain duty of science to direct attention towards them without
delay.&rdquo; N.B.&mdash;The Professor, when interviewed subsequently
by the Turin correspondent of the <i>Standard</i>, repudiated any
suggestion of supernatural agency, and said: &ldquo;All spiritualistic
phenomena can be understood and explained without any reference to the
intervention of the supernatural. Spiritualists affirm that the soul is
an emanation from God, while I contend that it is an emanation of the
brain. This is the whole thing in a nutshell. You therefore see how,
from this point of view, I cannot be called a spiritualist&mdash;at
least, in the sense in which the term is generally understood. Almost
all spiritualistic phenomena can be classed among those positive facts
which science can explain.&rdquo; However, in an article contributed by
him to the <i>Grand Magazine</i> for January, 1907, and entitled
&ldquo;Why I became a Spiritualist,&rdquo; Professor Lombroso admits
that he has felt himself &ldquo;compelled to yield to the conviction
that spiritualistic phenomena, if due in great part to the influence of
the medium, are likewise attributable to the <i>influence of
extra-terrestrial existences</i>, which may, perhaps, be compared to
the radio-activity which still persists in tubes after the radium which
originated them has disappeared.&rdquo; Professor Cesare Lombroso, it
may be mentioned, is Professor of Psychiatry at the University of
Turin, and the author of standard works on criminology, hypnotism, and
psychology, as well as of a number of valuable treatises relating to
cerebral study. Two of his publications, <i>Man of Genius</i> (1891)
and <i>Female Offender</i> (1895), have been issued in English.</p>
<p>The phenomena Professor Lombroso refers to are those which have
induced such eminent scientists as Wallace, Lodge, Hyslop, Barrett, and
Crookes to remain or to become supernaturalists. One, and to my mind
the chief, reason why these metapsychical phenomena are, as Professor
Lombroso tells us, of colossal importance&mdash;why science should
direct attention towards them without delay&mdash;is that, so soon as
they are universally acknowledged to be manifestations occurring in
obedience to one of Nature&rsquo;s laws&mdash;a law as yet not fully
understood&mdash;the last excuse for belief in the supernatural will
have vanished. Supernaturalism will receive its death-blow, and
Rationalism be infused with fresh life.</p>

<p>In defining his philosophic position he admits his own
&ldquo;inability to accept either popular Christianity or scholastic
Theism&rdquo; (see his Postscript, p. 521). He is of opinion that both
the metaphysical argument for God&rsquo;s existence and the arguments
for a God with moral attributes must be rejected, and &ldquo;<i>the man
who is sincere with himself and the facts</i>, but who remains

<p>The following are some further notes on the <i>spread of
Christianity</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>When, after more than three centuries, the spread became fairly
rapid, owing, as we have seen, to circumstances of a distinctly mundane
character, what was the effect on public morality? The Roman Empire
passed its zenith in the first half of the second century&mdash;under
Stoics. Historians agree that it was declining all through the third
century. On the other hand, it was making fresh progress morally in the
fourth century. It deteriorated morally after <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 380&ndash;90, the date of the triumph of Christianity!
Do these facts bear out the Christian contention that Christianity
purifies empire?</p>
<p>If we continue the history of Christianity&rsquo;s spread, we find
similar samples of Divine Providence and similar samples of moral
progress. Take, for instance, the facts connected with the conversion
of the barbarians, as related by the author of the apologetic work,
<i>Beneficial Influence of the Ancient Clergy</i>. We learn that
&ldquo;Many a deviation from primitive simplicity, dangerous though it
might justly seem to the integrity of the Roman faith, was productive
of consequences the most momentous to tribes who reverenced principally
the pomp and mysterious ceremony attendant on the faith which they
embraced, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>and would have scorned to bow down before
priests or altars whose faultless humility merely recalled the rude
shrines of their native forests.&rdquo; Also we learn that &ldquo;the
lavish piety of barbarian sovereigns&rdquo; directed &ldquo;the plunder
of suffering lands into the capacious coffers of the Church.&rdquo;
Although this led to &ldquo;the most fatal period of clerical
corruption,&rdquo; our apologist is yet able to see in it the guiding
hand of Providence establishing &ldquo;the constant grandeur of the
ecclesiastical edifice&rdquo;!</p>
<p>In Central Europe it was by force of arms that Charlemagne succeeded
in spreading Christianity. &ldquo;It cannot be doubted,&rdquo; we are
told, &ldquo;that the conquering hosts of the Franks were far more
effective in the conversion of Central Europe than could have been the
most self-denying of missionaries, or the most undoubtedly miraculous
of Italian relics.&rdquo; This fresh spread took place towards the
close of the eighth century. After a hundred years or so for the leaven
to work, we should expect to see a distinct advance in morality among
both the clergy and the laity. We find, on the contrary, that during
the whole of the tenth century the spectacle presented by society was
&ldquo;revolting.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not only did the clerical body present
sure tokens of that gigantic cancer which was wasting the energies of
the Church, but their degeneracy was relieved by nothing that was noble
or praiseworthy among the laity.&rdquo;</p>

negation of an idea, being, in fact, the negation of that which passes
away. When we begin discussing eternity we see that, from the point of
view of natural science, nothing is eternal except the ultimate
particles of matter and their forces; for no one of the thousandfold
phenomena and combinations under which matter and force present
themselves to us can be eternal&rdquo; (<i>Weismann on Heredity</i>,

<p class="first">The Rev. Henry Scott Jeffreys, of Sendai, contributed

People,&rdquo; to the <i>Japan Evangelist</i>. The following are some,
out of many, exceedingly significant admissions:&mdash;&ldquo;After

remarkable part is their devotion to ethics alone, utterly divorced
from religion. They love virtue for its own sake, and not from fear of
punishment or hope of reward.... They have eliminated from their system
of ethics not only heaven and hell, but God also.... To be sure, there
are religions (so-called), both native and foreign; but they have
little effect upon the popular conscience.... The conversion of this
people to the Christian faith is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399"

State&rsquo;s failure.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It is customary to scout the idea of State control as the panacea
for social evils. One is warned against grandmotherly legislation,
interference with the liberty of the private individual, etc. I may be
permitted, therefore, to give an illustration of its beneficial effect.
The Gothenburg system, by which the liquor traffic is judiciously
controlled, has, in spite of all opposition, fought its way
victoriously, and is now adopted, although partly modified, in most
towns in Sweden, and also in Norway and Finland. Thus the evil effects
of drink have been considerably mitigated; intemperance, pauperism, and
vice have been reduced. Would not legislation of this nature for the
removal of England&rsquo;s greatest curse be far better than
half-hearted measures that are palliative rather than remedial? Now
that the Church has taken up the temperance cause, could she not bring
her great influence to bear towards the introduction of some such
system, pitting herself against vested interests? Remarkable work is
being carried on by the Danish temperance societies on the basis of
allowing their members to regard beer of <i>low alcoholic strength</i>
as a temperance beverage. Australia has been watching New Zealand in
the matter of drink reform, and the Government of New South Wales, at
any rate, has found it necessary to fulfil pledges given at the last
general election, with the result that, among a certain class, there is
an immense diminution in the temptation to drink. Where the nature of
the case demands it, more drastic remedies must be applied. Thus
Belgium has forbidden the very presence of absinthe within her borders,
and in Switzerland&mdash;in some of the cantons, at all
events&mdash;the authorities have made up their minds to prohibit the
manufacture and sale of absinthe. Even in China an edict has now been
promulgated for the abolition of the use of opium, and an anti-opium
movement is spreading which bids fair to embarrass the interested
abettor of the vice&mdash;a Christian Government.</p>
<p>In their volume, <i>The Making of the Criminal</i> (Macmillan &amp;
Co.), Messrs. C. E. B. Russell and L. M. Rigby confirm the now
generally accepted view that it is, as a rule, between the ages of
sixteen and twenty-one that the habitual criminal is made, and show
that juvenile crime is a product of the wretched economic, social, and
family condition in which so many unhappy children are born and have to
live. The criminal is also recruited, as Dr. W. D. Morrison points out
(in a review of their book appearing in the <i>Tribune</i>, December
12th, 1906), from those whose home and social antecedents may be good
enough, but who are themselves either mentally or physically below the
average of the general community, and who, therefore, when times are
bad, drift insensibly into crime. When to all this unfavourable
environment we add an unfavourable heredity, we get a conjunction of
circumstances against which it is quite impossible for the unfortunate
to contend, even though he be aided by the &ldquo;gift of
freewill&rdquo; and by all the intercessory prayers of the Churches.
The Borstal system and other remedies recommended in <i>The Making of
the Criminal</i> are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400"
name="pb400">400</a>]</span>excellent in their way, but can be regarded
only as palliatives. They deal with the criminal after he has been
made. What is wanted is, to quote Dr. Morrison, &ldquo;a wise and
progressive statesmanship which will cut off crime at its roots&mdash;a
statesmanship which will devote itself with care and foresight to
ameliorating the whole material and moral conditions of existence of
the workman, the woman, and the child.&rdquo; And this statesmanship
will take an enlightened view of the population question, recognising
that it is in the diminution of the struggle for existence, not in the
rise of the birth-rate, that the material and moral condition of the
people can be ameliorated.</p>

fibres.</i></p>
</div>
<p>A quarter of a century ago Proctor remarked (see pp. 203&ndash;4 of
his essays, <i>Rough Ways Made Smooth</i>) that the phenomena of
hypnotism &ldquo;promise to afford valuable means of curing certain
ailments, and of influencing in useful ways certain powers and
functions of the body.&rdquo; He recognised &ldquo;possibilities which,
duly developed, might be found of extreme value to the human
race.&rdquo; Since these words were uttered this branch of science has
not stood still, and there seems every prospect that his prophecy will
be fulfilled in the near future. There are now cliniques for hypnotic
treatment in France (Dr. B&eacute;rillon&rsquo;s in Paris, for
example), Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and America.
&ldquo;The commencement of the present revival of hypnotism in England,
from its medical side, was apparently due to Dr. Lloyd Tuckey, who
happened to be in the neighbourhood of Nancy in August, 1888, and
visited Li&eacute;beault out of curiosity&rdquo; (see p. 35 of Dr.
Milne Bramwell&rsquo;s <i>Hypnotism: Its History, Practice, and
Theory</i> [Alexander Moring, Hanover Square, London; 2nd ed.,
1906]).</p>
<p>The following are some of the facts about the matter which should be
clearly understood and widely made known:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) &ldquo;The object of all hypnotic treatment ought to be the
development of the patient&rsquo;s control of his own organism&rdquo;
(see p. 436 of <i>Hypnotism: Its History, Practice, and
Theory</i>).</p>
<p>(2) The hypnotic control may be obtained without any effort on the
part of the operator, the effort formerly supposed to be required being
purely imaginary, and the hypnotic state being, in fact, obtained
without any operation whatever. Indeed, it has now been found that for
curative purposes the &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; may be conveyed without
throwing the patient into the hypnotic condition, and that anyone not
absolutely an idiot or insane may be amenable to the treatment.</p>
<p>(3) &ldquo;Both &lsquo;Scientist&rsquo; [the author is speaking of
Christian Scientists] and Suggestionist also use the same method for
creating belief&mdash;namely, Assertion.... Assertions are not made
clumsily, ignorantly, and at random, as assertions are in our daily
intercourse, but are made skilfully, with a purpose, and with a
knowledge of the effects they will produce&rdquo; (see p. 9 of the late
Richard Harte&rsquo;s T<i>he New Psychology; or, The Secret of
Happiness</i> [Fowler &amp; Co., London and New York]). Is this one of
the reasons why the believer is able to continue a believer in spite of
all disproof? Certainly he is constantly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb401" href="#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span>repeating assertions,
and sometimes these must get through to his subliminal
consciousness&mdash;his subjective mind.</p>
<p>(4) <i>Auto-suggestion.</i> The suggestion should be made when you
are composing yourself to sleep. Dr. Bramwell tells me that the best
time is on first waking in the morning, before dozing off again.</p>
<p>(5) &ldquo;Many cases of functional nervous disorder have recovered
under hypnotic treatment after the continued failure of other
methods.... Further, the diseases which frequently respond to hypnotic
treatment are often those in which drugs are of little or no avail. For
example, what medicine would one prescribe for a man who, in the midst
of mental and physical health, had suddenly become the prey of an
obsession?&rdquo; (see p. 435 of <i>Hypnotism: Its History, Practice,
and Theory</i>).</p>
<p>(6) &ldquo;<i>The volition is increased and the moral standard
raised</i>&rdquo; (see p. 437 of Hypnotism, etc.). &ldquo;Experience
proves that &lsquo;principles&rsquo; instilled into anyone while in the
hypnotic condition become irrevocably [?] fixed in the mind&rdquo; (p.
3 of Richard Harte&rsquo;s <i>Hypnotism and the Doctors</i>). Thus
degenerates, dipsomaniacs, morphinomaniacs, kleptomaniacs, sexual
perverts, and other unfortunates, may be reclaimed.</p>
<p>(7) &ldquo;&lsquo;Suggestion&rsquo; is of universal application, and
of incalculable power for good in almost every department of human
life.... The three principal ways in which suggestion (which has been
called &lsquo;the active principle&rsquo; of hypnotism) affects human
beings beneficially, in addition to curing diseases, are: By
facilitating education; by preventing crime, and reforming the
criminal; and by raising the general standard of manliness&mdash;of
courage, of independence of character, and of respect for self and
others&rdquo; (<i>ibid</i>, pp. 2&ndash;4).</p>
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The Medical Society for the Study of
Suggestive Therapeutics&rdquo; was constituted at the close of 1906.
Let us hope that it will soon rival the flourishing French <span lang=

5&ndash;6.&mdash;<i>It is the quality, not the quantity, of our
children that we have to keep to the forefront.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the great problem in a nutshell: to improve the
quality and diminish the quantity of mankind&mdash;that is, in
proportion to the means of securing for each a truly human life.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is not the quality rather than the quantity of children the
thing to be aimed at?&rdquo; (Mona Caird and Lady Grove on &ldquo;The
Position of Women,&rdquo; see pp. 118 and 128 of the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> for July, 1905). Besides, &ldquo;if we continued to maintain
the high birth-rate of the mid-Victorian epoch, it is certain that, in
the course of a few generations, there would be no elbow-room left in
our little islands. Already, indeed, Great Britain is, from many points
of view, over-populated. If all the people who are now crowded together
in the slums of our great towns were scattered over the country, there
would be practically no country left. England would have become a vast
suburb. That is not an ideal to which any patriotic Englishman would
care to look forward. Space and quiet are essential for the development
of some of the best qualities of human beings, and those persons who
too hastily regret a decline in the birth-rate must explain how they
propose to reconcile these essentials with an unlimited increase of our
present population&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href=
"#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>(<i>The Daily Graphic</i>, August
7th, 1905, art. &ldquo;A Declining Birth-rate&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Over-population spells strife, squalor, vice, crime&mdash;misery.
Dr. Barnardos and &ldquo;General&rdquo; Booths may get over the
&ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; difficulty by schemes for emigration to Canada
and elsewhere; but this is, at best, only a very temporary remedy. As
it is, thousands of white men are living <i>and dying</i> in climates
for which they are unadapted; while in some cases&mdash;in certain
portions of Africa, for example&mdash;they are ousting and making life
a burthen to the races that are adapted. We have only to look far
enough ahead to discover that the time must come when the world would
so teem with human-kind that even a Bishop of London or a President
Roosevelt would have to cry &ldquo;Hold! Enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the present moment this problem presses for a very early solution
in India. For many months in the year, as I have again and again seen
with my own eyes, masses of the agricultural population are entirely
without employment. Hence the constantly recurring famines, or partial
famines, in years of bad or indifferent rainfall. The population
problem, being intimately connected with many another problem, is one
of the utmost gravity; but, so long as men hold that to increase and
multiply is the command of God and a duty we owe to the State, it will
never be rightly, never be sensibly, solved. P.S.&mdash;Millions are
starving in China now (February, 1907).</p>

</div>
<p>The object of the Moral Instruction League (19, Buckingham Street,
Strand, London, W.C.) is to introduce systematic non-theological moral
instruction into all schools, and to make the formation of character
the chief aim of school life. Their contention is&mdash;and it seems a
wise one&mdash;that ethical principles on which we all agree should not
be associated in the schools of the State with theological principles
on which we all differ. Already certain education authorities are
providing for systematic moral instruction of a purely secular nature.
In the West Riding scheme it is expressly stated that it is to be
&ldquo;part of the <i>secular</i> instruction,&rdquo; while the
Cheshire scheme emphatically lays down that the moral instruction must
be non-theological. The authorities of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e9220" title="Source: Gorton">Groton</span>, Blackpool, Norwich,
York, and elsewhere, have supplied all the teachers of their schools
with copies of the Moral Instruction League&rsquo;s <i>Graduated
Syllabus of Moral Instruction for Elementary Schools</i>. The West
Riding Education Authority has adopted the Syllabus, and it is now in
use in the 1,270 schools, Provided and Non-Provided, of that authority.
In addition to these, numerous education authorities have decided to
make provision for moral instruction a part of the <i>secular</i>
instruction in their schools.</p>
<p>So much that is untrue has been said about the results of a purely
secular education by its strenuous opponents that it is high time for
the real truth to be known. This my readers will find in Mr. Joseph
McCabe&rsquo;s tractate, <i>The Truth About Secular Education: Its
History and Results</i> (Watts &amp; Co., 1906, paper covers, 6d.).</p>
<p>Among some excellent works intended to assist parents and teachers
in the non-theological character-training of children, I may mention
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>F. J. Gould&rsquo;s <i>The Children&rsquo;s Book
of Moral Lessons</i>, in three series (Watts &amp; Co.),
Hackwood&rsquo;s <i>Notes of Lessons on Moral Subjects</i>, Alice
Chesterton&rsquo;s <i>The Garden of Childhood</i> (Sonnenschein), Dr.
Felix Adler&rsquo;s <i>The Moral Instruction of Children</i> (Edward
Arnold), the Moral Instruction League and also the Leicester
<i>Syllabus</i>, and A. J. Waldegrave&rsquo;s <i>A Teacher&rsquo;s
Handbook of Moral Lessons</i> (Sonnenschein). Dr. F. H. Hayward&rsquo;s
<i>Secret of Herbart</i>, a powerful appeal to the teacher on the scope
and urgency of his moral mission, is now re-issued at 6d. (Watts). The
translation of Dr. F. W. F&ouml;rster&rsquo;s <i>Lebenskunde</i>, a
book replete with illustrative matter for the teacher, has been
undertaken by the Moral Instruction League. Mr. W. M. Salter&rsquo;s
essay, &ldquo;Why Live a Moral Life?&rdquo; is of exceptional merit.
This and other ethical essays may be obtained from the Secretary of the
Union of Ethical Societies, 19, Buckingham Street, Strand, W.C.; price
one penny each. One of the most important contributions to ethical
sociology that has appeared for many years is a work in two vols.
entitled <i>Morals in Evolution</i> (Chapman &amp; Hall; 1906), by Mr.
L. T. Hobhouse. I venture to predict that it will ere long be
recognised as the standard work on the subject. Mr. Hobhouse, it should
be noted, never wavers in his assertion of the supremacy of ethics over
all phases of religion.</p>

</div>
<p>Diaries recounting the sights seen by a lord of high degree in 1465
were published in 1851 by the Literary Society of Stuttgart. They
include an interesting account of all the shrines and relics seen
during his travels through Western Europe. The account of the relics
which he saw in our own Canterbury Cathedral admits of no curtailment:
&ldquo;First we saw the head-band of the Blessed Virgin, a piece of
Christ&rsquo;s garment, and three thorns from His Crown; then we saw
the bedstead of St. Thomas and his brain, and the blood of St. Thomas
and of St. John the Apostles. We saw also the sword with which St.
Thomas of Canterbury was beheaded; the hair of the Mother of God, and a
part of the Sepulchre. There was also shown to us a part of the
shoulder of the Blessed Simeon, who bore Christ in his arms; the head
of the blessed Lustrabena; one leg of St. George; a piece of the body
and the bones of St. Lawrence; a leg of the Bishop of St. Romanus; a
cup of St. Thomas, which he had been accustomed to use in administering
the Sacrament at Canterbury; a leg of the Virgin Milda; a leg of the
Virgin Eduarda. We also saw a tooth and a finger of St. Stephen the
Martyr; bones of the Virgin Catherine, and oil from her sepulchre,
which is said to flow to this day; hair of the blessed Virgin
[<i>sic!</i>] Magdalene; a tooth of St. Benedict; a finger of St.
Urban; the lips of one of the infants slain by Herod; bones of the
blessed Clement; bones of St. Vincent. Very many other things were also
shown to us, which are not set down by me in this place.&rdquo; Very
many other things have also been shown to me during my travels abroad
(from St. Anne de Beaupr&eacute; in Quebec to the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre in Jerusalem) which are not set down by me in this place, and
I may say that the grotesqueness of the frauds that are perpetrated is
only equalled by the gross ignorance and credulity of the worshippers.
The number of these &ldquo;relics&rdquo; scattered over <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>Christendom must amount to thousands upon
thousands. To stop the traffic in them, there is now a regulation that
if you buy a relic you commit mortal sin. The relics are still sold,
however; only the price is said to be for the frame or for the trouble,
or something to that effect. For a description of <i>La Bottega del
Papa</i> (the Pope&rsquo;s shop) or <i>La Santa Bottega</i> (the Holy
Shop) see Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s book, <i>The Roman Catholic Church in
Italy</i>. Regarding the early Church, see <i>Bible Myths</i>, pp.

</div>
<p>We have a striking example of this in Dean Farrar&rsquo;s tractate,
<i>The Bible and the Child</i> (James Clarke &amp; Co., 1897). The
passage runs as follows: &ldquo;There are a certain number of persons
who, when their minds have become stereotyped in foregone conclusions,
are simply <i>incapable</i> of grasping new truths. They become
obstructionists, and not infrequently bigoted obstructionists. As
convinced as the Pope of their own personal infallibility, their
attitude towards those who see that the old views are no longer tenable
is an attitude of anger and alarm. This is the usual temper of the
<i lang="la">odium theologicum</i>. It would, if it could, grasp the
thumbscrew and the rack of medi&aelig;val Inquisitors, and would, in
the last resource, hand over all opponents to the scaffold or the
stake. Those whose intellects have been thus petrified by custom and
advancing years are, of all others, the most hopeless to deal with.
They have made themselves incapable of fair and rational examination of
the truths which they impugn. They think they can, by mere assertion,
overthrow results arrived at by the life-long inquiries of the ablest
student, while they have not given a day&rsquo;s serious or impartial
study to them. They fancy that even the ignorant, if only they be what
is called orthodox, are justified in strong denunciation of men quite
as truthful, and often incomparably more able than themselves. Off-hand
dogmatists of this stamp, who usually abound among professional
religionists, think that they can refute any number of scholars,
however profound and however pious, if only they shout
&lsquo;Infidel&rsquo; with sufficient loudness.&rdquo;</p>

Christian Church?</i></p>
</div>
<p>Serfdom in England was fully extinguished only in 1600, and the Act
for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Colonies was passed
only in 1833. For eighteen long centuries Christianity countenanced the
atrocious inhumanities of the slave trade. The very irons used by the
native chiefs for shackling the prisoners when handing them over to the
Christian traders were made in Birmingham, and the greatest horrors of
slavery have been exhibited only under the rule of the Christian
slave-owner. We can form some idea of the inhumanity then displayed
from the treatment of the coloured races by the white man in Africa
to-day. Read, for instance, the accounts of the Congo atrocities, or of
the German Colonial scandals. Read, again, some home-truths about our
own Colonies in <i>Labour and other Questions in South Africa</i>, by
Medicus (T. Fisher Unwin, 1903). The white man has indeed a burden to
bear&mdash;the burden of his own iniquity. Regarding negro slavery, Dr.
Westermarck clearly shows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href=
"#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>(in his work, <i>The Origin and
Development of the Moral Ideas</i>) that &ldquo;this system of slavery,
which, at least in the British Colonies and the slave States, surpassed
in cruelty the slavery of any pagan country, ancient or modern, was not
only recognised by Christian Governments, but was supported by the
large bulk of the clergy, Catholic and Protestant alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>History is repeating itself to-day, and my previous allusions to the
present situation in Russia are all too brief. I would ask my readers
kindly to put to themselves the following crucial questions: To what
party do the religious bigots and their partisans belong? Is it not to
the reactionary party, the party that sets its face against reform? On
what do the reactionaries chiefly rely for the retention of their hold
upon the bulk of the people? Is it not on a peasantry wallowing in
ignorance and steeped in superstition? What are the actual instruments
employed for maintaining their power? Do they not consist of corrupt
officials and cruel Cossacks? Who are responsible for shameless acts of
persecution, and, indeed, very largely for all the bloodshed, strife,
and anarchy? Is it not the orthodox Church and her supporters? Is it
too much to say, with the Rev. J. Lawson-Forster, that &ldquo;the
Russian Church has become the tool of murderers&rdquo;? (Mr.
Lawson-Forster expressed himself in these words when presiding at the
great public meeting held at the Brondesbury Synagogue to protest
against the recent outrages in Russia.) To what party do the
Freethinkers belong? Are they not all, everyone of them, adherents of
the party desirous of reform and of religious toleration? With regard
to religious persecution generally, Christians might study with
advantage Buckle&rsquo;s <i>History of Civilisation in England</i>, or
Lecky&rsquo;s <i>History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of
Rationalism in Europe</i>, or C. T. Gorham&rsquo;s <i>Faith: Its Freaks
and Follies</i> (Rationalist Press Association), or the latest work on
the subject, <i>Religious Persecution</i>, by E. S. P. Haynes
(Duckworth; a revised edition has now been issued by the R. P. A. at
6d.). Few realise that the favourite method for overcoming the scruples
of the heretic&mdash;torture&mdash;was used in England so late as
1640.</p>

<p>If Major Murray had stopped short at offering us a somewhat highly
coloured picture of the past and present conditions ruling among
Christian nations, and at inculcating the necessity of our being in
readiness to face the inevitable, few of us would be found to quarrel,
in the main, with his conclusions. But when he tells us that
&ldquo;Peace never has been, and <i>never will be</i> [italics are
mine], as long as the passions of mankind endure, more than a lull
between the storms of war,&rdquo; then the better-informed and
peace-loving Rationalist will beg to differ with him. He feels that
this gospel of universal hatred is being carried too far. Never is a
very long time. Major Murray says: &ldquo;No great nation will ever
submit to arbitration any interest that it regards as absolutely
vital.&rdquo; Did not our British forefathers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>think, and with more reason, that &ldquo;men of
honour&rdquo; could settle their disputes only by the duel? May we not
trust that the decisions of learned and unbiassed judges will be
equitable, and therefore that their acceptance will redound to the
honour of the great nations concerned?</p>
<p>Natural selection, or, as we have elsewhere called it, natural
murder, ceased to have full power over men on the day that man
commenced to control his environment. Since then he has been constantly
engaged in making nature do some work for him, in altering the
environment in which he finds himself <i>instead of letting it alter
him</i>. Now that he is equipped, better than ever before in his
history, for this task, now that he has learnt more of the secrets of
Nature&mdash;of her crude and cruel processes&mdash;is he going to
acquiesce tamely, and make no use of his knowledge? Now the nature of
the malady has been diagnosed, and now the proper remedies have been
discovered, will he not set about the cure? Is the struggle for
existence, with all its attendant horrors, to be perpetuated? Does the
end&mdash;the survival of the fittest&mdash;justify the
means&mdash;over-production and murder? Cannot the same and better
results be attained by a process less crude, less cruel? Nature
procures adaptation to existing environment by methods fraught with
untold suffering for the sentient, and the obvious course is for man to
reverse the process, bringing the environment into harmony with his
existing constitution. Of a truth, nature is, as Major Murray reminds
us, red in tooth and claw; but science is both able and willing to tame
the shrew.</p>

the Crimean War, the great masses of the Russian people saw but a
spirited defence of the Cross against the Crescent, wherein, from their

<p class="first">And compare: &ldquo;The very ideas and efforts which
have led men to struggle against the Papal Church are exactly those
which are exorcising the demon of militarism from the soul of
France&rdquo; (<i>Contemporary Review</i> for January, 1905, art.
&ldquo;France and Rome&rdquo;). Or again the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>following, reported in the daily papers:
&ldquo;A petition to stop the war between Russia and Japan owes its
inception to Signor Carlo Romissi, Deputy and editor of the
<i>Secolo</i> of Milan. The petition has penetrated into every
workshop, household, and school, and roused the people to a passionate
desire for peace, not only between the belligerents in the Far East,
but between all nations.&rdquo; The <i>Secolo</i> is the most
widely-read Freethought paper in Italy.</p>
<p>Though it may be a long time before our efforts are rewarded, is
that any reason for not making a commencement in the right direction?
Let me give an instance. The effort now being made to popularise the
international language &ldquo;Esperanto&rdquo; is one such
commencement. Could not the Church spare a little of her military
ardour (exhibited in the arm-chair and pulpit) for supporting peaceful
projects of this nature? This one, at any rate, among the many to be
found on the Rationalist programme, is not contrary to her teaching;
but I have not as yet heard of any ecclesiastical support to a scheme
that will undoubtedly conduce to a better acquaintance between the
peoples of different nationalities. It is Rationalist and
liberal-minded philanthropists (Mr. W. T. Stead, <i>e.g.</i>) who are
at present chiefly interested in the movement.</p>
<p>During the Boer War one was continually hearing declamations from
the pulpit to the effect that war is a necessary evil. For instance,
the late Bishop of Calcutta, Dr. Welldon, actually advocated war on the
ground that it was a means of keeping a nation virile. Has the Boer War
made us more virile? Whatever Imperial necessity there may have been
for it, owing to blunders in the past and the existing condition of
affairs, the certain effects of it, so far as we can see, have been the
untimely destruction of some of the flower of our race, sorrow spread
throughout the length and breadth of the land by many bereavements, the
burden of a great debt, and the unemployed question rendered more acute
than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brotherhood of man is a long way off&mdash;it may never
be reached; but as an ideal it is better worth having than that of
half-a-dozen sullen empires, trading only within their own boundaries,
and shut up behind high tariff walls over which they peer suspiciously,
scanning one another&rsquo;s exports and imports with jealous eyes, and
making from time to time fawning alliances with one rival, while
harbouring enmity with another, maintaining millions of men under arms
and spending millions of pounds in armaments, and all the time waiting,
waiting, waiting for an affrighted sun to rise upon the day of
Armageddon.... But nobler things lie before us and a brighter
dawn.&rdquo; (See Mr. Birrell&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;Patriotism and
Christianity,&rdquo; in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for February,
1905.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=

willing to be instructed I suggest a perusal of Doane&rsquo;s <i>Bible
Myths and their Parallels in Other Religions</i> (New York: The
Commonwealth Company), where they will find some intensely interesting
information which has been laboriously gathered from innumerable
volumes, ancient and modern. The few inaccuracies occurring in it are
of a trivial nature; besides, as the author invariably quotes his
authorities, his statements can be verified and the trustworthiness of
his authority for them ascertained. I may add that I found this work of
considerable assistance at the commencement of my study of Comparative
Mythology.</p>
